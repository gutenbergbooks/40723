<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, it matters little
when, and in stalwart England, it
matters little where, a fierce battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was fought. It was fought upon a long summer
day when the waving grass was green. Many a
wild flower formed by the Almighty Hand to be a
perfumed goblet for the dew, felt its enamelled cup
fill high with blood that day, and shrinking dropped.
Many an insect deriving its delicate color from harmless
leaves and herbs, was stained anew that day by
dying men, and marked its frightened way with an
unnatural track. The painted butterfly took blood
into the air upon the edges of its wings. The stream
ran red. The trodden ground became a quagmire,
whence, from sullen pools collected in the prints of
human feet and horses&rsquo; hoofs, the one prevailing hue
still lowered and glimmered at the sun.</p>

<p>Heaven keep us from a knowledge of the sights
the moon beheld upon that field, when, coming up
above the black line of distant rising-ground, softened
and blurred at the edge by trees, she rose into the
sky and looked upon the plain, strewn with upturned
faces that had once at mothers&rsquo; breasts sought
mothers&rsquo; eyes, or slumbered happily. Heaven keep
us from a knowledge of the secrets whispered afterwards
upon the tainted wind that blew across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
scene of that day&rsquo;s work and that night&rsquo;s death and
suffering! Many a lonely moon was bright upon the
battle-ground, and many
a star kept mournful watch
upon it, and many a wind
from every quarter of the
earth blew over it, before
the traces of the fight were
worn away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>They lurked and lingered for a long time, but
survived in little things, for Nature, far above the
evil passions of men, soon recovered Her serenity, and
smiled upon the guilty battle-ground as she had done
before, when it was innocent. The larks sang high
above it, the swallows skimmed and dipped and flitted
to and fro, the shadows of the flying clouds pursued
each other swiftly, over grass and corn and turnip-field
and wood, and over roof and church-spire in the
nestling town among the trees, away into the bright
distance on the borders of the sky and earth,
where the red sunsets faded. Crops were sown,
and grew up, and were gathered in; the stream
that had been crimsoned, turned a watermill; men
whistled at the plough; gleaners and haymakers
were seen in quiet groups at work; sheep and
oxen pastured; boys whooped and called, in fields,
to scare away the birds; smoke rose from cottage
chimneys; sabbath bells rang peacefully; old people
lived and died; the timid creatures of the field,
and simple flowers of the bush and garden, grew
and withered in their destined terms: and all
upon the fierce and bloody battle-ground, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
thousands upon thousands had been killed in the
great fight.</p>

<p>But there were deep green patches in the growing
corn at first, that people looked at awfully. Year
after year they re-appeared; and it was known that
underneath those fertile spots, heaps of men and
horses lay buried, indiscriminately, enriching the
ground. The husbandmen who ploughed those
places, shrunk from the great worms abounding
there; and the sheaves they yielded, were, for
many a long year, called the Battle Sheaves, and
set apart; and no one ever knew a Battle Sheaf
to be among the last load at a Harvest Home. For
a long time, every furrow that was turned, revealed
some fragments of the fight. For a long time, there
were wounded trees upon the battle-ground; and
scraps of hacked and broken fence and wall, where
deadly struggles had been made; and trampled
parts where not a leaf or blade would grow. For a
long time, no village-girl would dress her hair or
bosom with the sweetest flower from that field
of death: and after many a year had come and
gone, the berries growing there, were still believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to leave too deep a stain upon the hand that plucked
them.</p>

<p>The Seasons in their course, however, though they
passed as lightly as the summer clouds themselves,
obliterated, in the lapse of time, even these remains
of the old conflict; and wore away such legendary
traces of it as the neighbouring people carried in
their minds, until they dwindled into old wives&rsquo; tales,
dimly remembered round the winter fire, and waning
every year. Where the wild flowers and berries had
so long remained upon the stem untouched, gardens
arose, and houses were built, and children played at
battles on the turf. The wounded trees had long ago
made Christmas logs, and blazed and roared away.
The deep green patches were no greener now than
the memory of those who lay in dust below. The
ploughshare still turned up from time to time some
rusty bits of metal, but it was hard to say what use
they had ever served, and those who found them
wondered and disputed. An old dinted corslet, and
a helmet, had been hanging in the church so long,
that the same weak half-blind old man who tried in
vain to make them out above the whitewashed arch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had marvelled at them as a baby. If the host
slain upon the field, could have been for a moment
reanimated in the
forms in which
they fell, each
upon the spot that
was the bed of his
untimely death, gashed
and ghastly soldiers
would have stared in, hundreds
deep, at household door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and window; and would have risen on the hearths of
quiet homes; and would have been the garnered store
of barns and granaries; and would have started up
between the cradled infant and its nurse; and would
have floated with the stream, and whirled round on
the mill, and crowded the orchard, and burdened the
meadow, and piled the rickyard high with dying men.
So altered was the battle-ground, where thousands
upon thousands had been killed in the great fight.</p>

<p>Nowhere more altered, perhaps, about a hundred
years ago, than in one little orchard attached to an
old stone house with a honeysuckle porch: where, on
a bright autumn morning, there were sounds of music
and laughter, and where two girls danced merrily
together on the grass, while some half-dozen peasant
women standing on ladders, gathering the apples from
the trees, stopped in their work to look down, and share
their enjoyment. It was a pleasant, lively, natural
scene; a beautiful day, a retired spot; and the two
girls, quite unconstrained and careless, danced in the
very freedom and gaiety of their hearts.</p>

<p>If there were no such thing as display in the
world, my private opinion is, and I hope you agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
with me, that we might get on a great deal better
than we do, and might be infinitely more agreeable
company than we are. It was charming to see how
these girls danced. They had no spectators but
the apple-pickers on the ladders. They were very
glad to please them, but they danced to please themselves
(or at least you would have supposed so); and
you could no more help admiring, than they could help
dancing. How they did dance!</p>

<p>Not like opera dancers. Not at all. And not like
Madame Anybody&rsquo;s finished pupils. Not the least.
It was not quadrille dancing, nor minuet dancing,
nor even country-dance dancing. It was neither in
the old style, nor the new style, nor the French
style, nor the English style; though it may have
been, by accident, a trifle in the Spanish style, which
is a free and joyous one, I am told, deriving a delightful
air of off-hand inspiration, from the chirping
little castanets. As they danced among the orchard
trees, and down the groves of stems and back again,
and twirled each other lightly round and round, the
influence of their airy motion seemed to spread and
spread, in the sun-lighted scene, like an expanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
circle in the water. Their streaming hair and fluttering
skirts, the elastic grass beneath their feet, the
boughs that rustled in the morning air&mdash;the flashing
leaves, their speckled shadows on the soft green
ground&mdash;the balmy wind that swept along the landscape,
glad to turn the distant windmill, cheerily&mdash;everything
between the two girls, and the man and
team at plough upon the ridge of land, where they
showed against the sky as if they were the last
things in the world&mdash;seemed dancing too.</p>

<p>At last the younger of the dancing sisters, out of
breath, and laughing gaily, threw herself upon a
bench to rest. The other leaned against a tree
hard by. The music, a wandering harp and fiddle,
left off with a flourish, as if it boasted of its freshness;
though, the truth is, it had gone at such a pace,
and worked itself to such a pitch of competition with
the dancing, that it never could have held on half a
minute longer. The apple-pickers on the ladders
raised a hum and murmur of applause, and then, in
keeping with the sound, bestirred themselves to work
again, like bees.</p>

<p>The more actively, perhaps, because an elderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
gentleman, who was no other than Doctor Jeddler
himself&mdash;it was Doctor Jeddler&rsquo;s house and orchard,
you should know, and these were Doctor Jeddler&rsquo;s
daughters&mdash;came bustling out to see what was the
matter, and who the deuce played music on his property,
before breakfast. For he was a great philosopher,
Doctor Jeddler, and not very musical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Music and dancing <em>to-day</em>!&rdquo; said the Doctor,
stopping short, and speaking to himself, &ldquo;I thought
they dreaded to-day. But it&rsquo;s a world of contradictions.
Why, Grace; why, Marion!&rdquo; he added, aloud,
&ldquo;is the world more mad than usual this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make some allowance for it, father, if it be,&rdquo;
replied his younger daughter, Marion, going close to
him, and looking into his face, &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s
birth-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s birth-day, Puss,&rdquo; replied the Doctor.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s always somebody&rsquo;s birth-day?
Did you never hear how many new performers enter
on this&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible to speak
gravely of it&mdash;on this preposterous and ridiculous
business called Life, every minute?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, father!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not you, of course; you&rsquo;re a woman&mdash;almost,&rdquo;
said the Doctor. &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; and he
looked into the pretty face, still close to his, &ldquo;I suppose
it&rsquo;s <em>your</em> birth-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Do you really, father?&rdquo; cried his pet
daughter, pursing up her red lips to be kissed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! Take my love with it,&rdquo; said the Doctor,
imprinting his upon them; &ldquo;and many happy returns
of the&mdash;the idea!&mdash;of the day. The notion of wishing
happy returns in such a farce as this,&rdquo; said the
Doctor to himself, &ldquo;is good! Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Jeddler was, as I have said, a great philosopher;
and the heart and mystery of his philosophy
was, to look upon the world as a gigantic practical
joke: as something too absurd to be considered
seriously, by any rational man. His system of belief
had been, in the beginning, part and parcel of the
battle-ground on which he lived; as you shall presently
understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! But how did you get the music?&rdquo; asked
the Doctor. &ldquo;Poultry-stealers, of course. Where did
the minstrels come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alfred sent the music,&rdquo; said his daughter Grace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
adjusting a few simple flowers in her sister&rsquo;s hair,
with which, in her admiration of that youthful beauty,
she had herself adorned it half-an-hour before, and
which the dancing had disarranged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Alfred sent the music, did he?&rdquo; returned
the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He met it coming out of the town as
he was entering early. The men are travelling on
foot, and rested there last night; and as it was
Marion&rsquo;s birth-day, and he thought it would please
her, he sent them on, with a pencilled note to me,
saying that if I thought so too, they had come to
serenade her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the Doctor, carelessly, &ldquo;he always
takes your opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my opinion being favorable,&rdquo; said Grace,
good-humouredly; and pausing for a moment to
admire the pretty head she decorated, with her own
thrown back; &ldquo;and Marion being in high spirits,
and beginning to dance, I joined her: and so we
danced to Alfred&rsquo;s music till we were out of breath.
And we thought the music all the gayer for being
sent by Alfred. Didn&rsquo;t we, dear Marion?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, Grace. How you teaze me
about Alfred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teaze you by mentioning your lover!&rdquo; said her
sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t much care to have him mentioned,&rdquo;
said the wilful beauty, stripping the petals
from some flowers she held, and scattering them on
the ground. &ldquo;I am almost tired of hearing of him;
and as to his being my lover&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Don&rsquo;t speak lightly of a true heart,
which is all your own, Marion,&rdquo; cried her sister,
&ldquo;even in jest. There is not a truer heart than Alfred&rsquo;s
in the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Marion, raising her eyebrows with
a pleasant air of careless consideration, &ldquo;perhaps
not. But I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s any great merit
in that. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want him to be so very true.
I never asked him. If he expects that I&mdash;&mdash;. But,
dear Grace, why need we talk of him at all, just now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was agreeable to see the graceful figures of the
blooming sisters, twined together, lingering among
the trees, conversing thus, with earnestness opposed
to lightness, yet with love responding tenderly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
love. And it was very curious indeed to see the
younger sister&rsquo;s eyes suffused with tears; and something
fervently and deeply felt, breaking through
the wilfulness of what she said, and striving with it
painfully.</p>

<p>The difference between them, in respect of age,
could not exceed four years at most: but Grace, as
often happens in such cases, when no mother watches
over both (the Doctor&rsquo;s wife was dead), seemed, in
her gentle care of her young sister, and in the
steadiness of her devotion to her, older than she
was; and more removed, in course of nature, from
all competition with her, or participation, otherwise
than through her sympathy and true affection, in
her wayward fancies, than their ages seemed to
warrant. Great character of mother, that, even
in this shadow, and faint reflection of it, purifies the
heart, and raises the exalted nature nearer to the
angels!</p>

<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s reflections, as he looked after them,
and heard the purport of their discourse, were limited,
at first, to certain merry meditations on the folly of
all loves and likings, and the idle imposition practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
on themselves by young people, who believed,
for a moment, that there could be anything serious
in such bubbles, and were always undeceived&mdash;always!</p>

<p>But the home-adorning, self-denying qualities of
Grace, and her sweet temper, so gentle and retiring,
yet including so much constancy and bravery of
spirit, seemed all expressed to him in the contrast
between her quiet household figure and that of his
younger and more beautiful child; and he was sorry
for her sake&mdash;sorry for them both&mdash;that life should
be such a very ridiculous business as it was.</p>

<p>The Doctor never dreamed of inquiring whether
his children, or either of them, helped in any way to
make the scheme a serious one. But then he was a
Philosopher.</p>

<p>A kind and generous man by nature, he had
stumbled, by chance, over that common Philosopher&rsquo;s
stone (much more easily discovered than the object
of the alchemist&rsquo;s researches), which sometimes trips
up kind and generous men, and has the fatal property
of turning gold to dross, and every precious thing to
poor account.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Britain!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;Britain! Halloa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A small man, with an uncommonly sour and discontented
face, emerged from the house, and returned
to this call the unceremonious acknowledgment of
&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the breakfast table?&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the house,&rdquo; returned Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to spread it out here, as you were
told last night?&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know that there are gentlemen coming? That there&rsquo;s
business to be done this morning, before the coach
comes by? That this is a very particular occasion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do anything, Doctor Jeddler, till the
women had done getting in the apples, could I?&rdquo;
said Britain, his voice rising with his reasoning, so
that it was very loud at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, have they done now?&rdquo; returned the
Doctor, looking at his watch, and clapping his hands.
&ldquo;Come! make haste! where&rsquo;s Clemency?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here am I, Mister,&rdquo; said a voice from one of the
ladders, which a pair of clumsy feet descended briskly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all done now. Clear away, gals. Everything
shall be ready for you in half a minute, Mister.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>With that she began to bustle about most
vigorously; presenting, as she did so, an appearance
sufficiently peculiar to justify a word of introduction.</p>

<p>She was about thirty years old; and had a sufficiently
plump and cheerful face, though it was twisted
up into an odd expression of tightness that made it
comical. But the extraordinary homeliness of her
gait and manner, would have superseded any face in
the world. To say that she had two left legs, and
somebody else&rsquo;s arms; and that all four limbs seemed
to be out of joint, and to start from perfectly wrong
places when they were set in motion; is to offer the
mildest outline of the reality. To say that she was
perfectly content and satisfied with these arrangements,
and regarded them as being no business of
hers, and took her arms and legs as they came, and
allowed them to dispose of themselves just as it happened,
is to render faint justice to her equanimity.
Her dress was a prodigious pair of self-willed shoes,
that never wanted to go where her feet went; blue stockings;
a printed gown of many colours, and the most hideous
pattern procurable for money; and a white apron.
She always wore short sleeves, and always had, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
some accident, grazed elbows, in which she took so
lively an interest that she was continually trying to
turn them round and get impossible views of them.
In general, a little cap perched somewhere on her
head; though it was rarely to be met with in the
place usually occupied in other subjects, by that
article of dress; but from head to foot she was scrupulously
clean, and maintained a kind of dislocated
tidiness. Indeed her laudable anxiety to be tidy and
compact in her own conscience as well as in the
public eye, gave rise to one of her most startling
evolutions, which was to grasp herself sometimes by
a sort of wooden handle (part of her clothing, and
familiarly called a busk), and wrestle as it were with
her garments, until they fell into a symmetrical
arrangement.</p>

<p>Such, in outward form and garb, was Clemency
Newcome; who was supposed to have unconsciously
originated a corruption of her own christian name,
from Clementina (but nobody knew, for the deaf old
mother, a very phenomenon of age, whom she had
supported almost from a child, was dead, and she
had no other relation); who now busied herself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
preparing the table; and who stood, at intervals,
with her bare red arms crossed, rubbing her grazed
elbows with opposite hands, and staring at it very composedly,
until she suddenly remembered something
else it wanted, and jogged off to fetch it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are them two lawyers a-coming, Mister!&rdquo;
said Clemency, in a tone of no very great good-will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; cried the Doctor, advancing to the gate
to meet them. &ldquo;Good morning, good morning!
Grace, my dear! Marion! Here are Messrs. Snitchey
and Craggs. Where&rsquo;s Alfred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be back directly, father, no doubt,&rdquo; said
Grace. &ldquo;He had so much to do this morning in his
preparations for departure, that he was up and out by
daybreak. Good morning, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies!&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, &ldquo;For Self and
Craggs,&rdquo; who bowed, &ldquo;good morning. Miss,&rdquo; to
Marion, &ldquo;I kiss your hand.&rdquo; Which he did. &ldquo;And
I wish you&rdquo;&mdash;which he might or might not, for he
didn&rsquo;t look, at first sight, like a gentleman troubled
with many warm outpourings of soul, in behalf of
other people, &ldquo;a hundred happy returns of this
auspicious day.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha!&rdquo; laughed the Doctor thoughtfully,
with his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;The great farce in
a hundred acts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t, I am sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey,
standing a small professional blue bag against one
leg of the table, &ldquo;cut the great farce short for this
actress, at all events, Doctor Jeddler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the Doctor. &ldquo;God forbid! May
she live to laugh at it, as long as she <em>can</em> laugh, and
then say, with the French wit, &lsquo;The farce is ended;
draw the curtain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The French wit,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, peeping
sharply into his blue bag, &ldquo;was wrong, Doctor
Jeddler; and your philosophy is altogether wrong,
depend upon it, as I have often told you. Nothing
serious in life! What do you call law?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A joke,&rdquo; replied the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever go to law?&rdquo; asked Mr. Snitchey,
looking out of the blue bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; returned the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ever do,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, &ldquo;perhaps
you&rsquo;ll alter that opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craggs, who seemed to be represented by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Snitchey, and to be conscious of little or no separate
existence or personal individuality, offered a remark
of his own in this place. It involved the only idea of
which he did not stand seised and possessed in equal
moieties with Snitchey; but he had some partners in
it among the wise men of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s made a great deal too easy,&rdquo; said Mr. Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Law is?&rdquo; asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Craggs, &ldquo;everything is. Everything
appears to me to be made too easy, now-a-days. It&rsquo;s
the vice of these times. If the world is a joke (I am
not prepared to say it isn&rsquo;t), it ought to be made a
very difficult joke to crack. It ought to be as hard a
struggle, Sir, as possible. That&rsquo;s the intention.
But it&rsquo;s being made far too easy. We are oiling the
gates of life. They ought to be rusty. We shall
have them beginning to turn, soon, with a smooth
sound. Whereas they ought to grate upon their
hinges, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Craggs seemed positively to grate upon his own
hinges, as he delivered this opinion; to which he communicated
immense effect&mdash;being a cold, hard, dry
man, dressed in grey and white, like a flint; with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
small twinkles in his eyes, as if something struck
sparks out of them. The three natural kingdoms,
indeed, had each a fanciful representative among this
brotherhood of disputants: for Snitchey was like a
magpie or a raven (only not so sleek), and the Doctor
had a streaked face like a winter-pippin, with here
and there a dimple to express the peckings of the
birds, and a very little bit of pigtail behind, that
stood for the stalk.</p>

<p>As the active figure of a handsome young man,
dressed for a journey, and followed by a porter, bearing
several packages and baskets, entered the orchard
at a brisk pace, and with an air of gaiety and hope
that accorded well with the morning,&mdash;these three drew
together, like the brothers of the sister Fates, or like
the Graces most effectually disguised, or like the three
weird prophets on the heath, and greeted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy returns, Alf,&rdquo; said the Doctor, lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred happy returns of this auspicious day,
Mr. Heathfield,&rdquo; said Snitchey, bowing low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Returns!&rdquo; Craggs murmured in a deep voice,
all alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what a battery!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
short, &ldquo;and one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;all foreboders
of no good, in the great sea before me. I am glad
you are not the first I have met this morning: I
should have taken it for a bad omen. But Grace
was the first&mdash;sweet, pleasant Grace&mdash;so I defy
you all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Mister, <em>I</em> was the first you know,&rdquo;
said Clemency Newcome. &ldquo;She was a walking out
here, before sunrise, you remember. I was in the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true! Clemency was the first,&rdquo; said
Alfred. &ldquo;So I defy you with Clemency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;for Self and Craggs,&rdquo; said Snitchey.
&ldquo;What a defiance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so bad a one as it appears, may be,&rdquo; said
Alfred, shaking hands heartily with the Doctor, and
also with Snitchey and Craggs, and then looking
round. &ldquo;Where are the&mdash;Good Heavens!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a start, productive for the moment of a closer
partnership between Jonathan Snitchey and Thomas
Craggs than the subsisting articles of agreement in
that wise contemplated, he hastily betook himself to
where the sisters stood together, and&mdash;however, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
needn&rsquo;t more particularly explain his manner of
saluting Marion first, and Grace afterwards, than by
hinting that Mr. Craggs may possibly have considered
it &ldquo;too easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps to change the subject, Doctor Jeddler
made a hasty move towards the breakfast, and they
all sat down at table. Grace presided; but so discreetly
stationed herself, as to cut off her sister
and Alfred from the rest of the company. Snitchey
and Craggs sat at opposite corners, with the blue
bag between them for safety; and the Doctor took
his usual position, opposite to Grace. Clemency
hovered galvanically about the table, as waitress;
and the melancholy Britain, at another and a smaller
board, acted as Grand Carver of a round of beef,
and a ham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meat?&rdquo; said Britain, approaching Mr. Snitchey,
with the carving knife and fork in his hands, and
throwing the question at him like a missile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; returned the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do <em>you</em> want any?&rdquo; to Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lean, and well done,&rdquo; replied that gentleman.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i_06"></a>
<img src="images/i_06.jpg" width="338" height="582" alt="The Parting Breakfast" title="The Parting Breakfast" />
</div>

<p>Having executed these orders, and moderately supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Doctor (he seemed to know that nobody else
wanted anything
to eat), he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lingered as near the Firm as he decently could,
watching, with an austere eye, their disposition of the
viands, and but once relaxing the severe expression
of his face. This was on the occasion of Mr. Craggs,
whose teeth were not of the best, partially choking,
when he cried out with great animation, &ldquo;I thought
he was gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Alfred,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;for a word or
two of business, while we are yet at breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we are yet at breakfast,&rdquo; said Snitchey
and Craggs, who seemed to have no present idea of
leaving off.</p>

<p>Although Alfred had not been breakfasting, and
seemed to have quite enough business on his hands as
it was, he respectfully answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anything could be serious,&rdquo; the Doctor began,
&ldquo;in such a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farce as this, Sir,&rdquo; hinted Alfred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In such a farce as this,&rdquo; observed the Doctor,
&ldquo;it might be this recurrence, on the eve of separation,
of a double birth-day, which is connected with many
associations pleasant to us four, and with the recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of a long and amicable intercourse. That&rsquo;s not
to the purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes, yes, Doctor Jeddler,&rdquo; said the young
man. &ldquo;It is to the purpose. Much to the purpose, as
my heart bears witness this morning; and as yours
does too, I know, if you would let it speak. I leave
your house to-day; I cease to be your ward to-day;
we part with tender relations stretching far behind us,
that never can be exactly renewed, and with others
dawning yet before us,&rdquo; he looked down at Marion
beside him, &ldquo;fraught with such considerations as I
must not trust myself to speak of now. Come,
come!&rdquo; he added, rallying his spirits and the Doctor
at once, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a serious grain in this large
foolish dust-heap, Doctor. Let us allow to-day,
that there is One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;Hear him! Ha,
ha, ha! Of all days in the foolish year. Why on
this day, the great battle was fought on this ground.
On this ground where we now sit, where I saw my
two girls dance this morning, where the fruit has just
been gathered for our eating from these trees, the
roots of which are struck in Men, not earth,&mdash;so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lives were lost, that within my recollection, generations
afterwards, a churchyard full of bones, and dust
of bones, and chips of cloven skulls, has been dug up
from underneath our feet here. Yet not a hundred
people in that battle, knew for what they fought, or
why; not a hundred of the inconsiderate rejoicers in
the victory, why they rejoiced. Not half a hundred
people were the better, for the gain or loss. Not
half-a-dozen men agree to this hour on the cause or
merits; and nobody, in short, ever knew anything
distinct about it, but the mourners of the slain.
Serious, too!&rdquo; said the Doctor, laughing. &ldquo;Such a
system!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all this seems to me,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;to be
very serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serious!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;If you allowed
such things to be serious, you must go mad, or die,
or climb up to the top of a mountain, and turn
hermit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides&mdash;so long ago,&rdquo; said Alfred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long ago!&rdquo; returned the Doctor. &ldquo;Do you
know what the world has been doing, ever since?
Do you know what else it has been doing? <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It has gone to law a little,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Snitchey, stirring his tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although the way out has been always made too
easy,&rdquo; said his partner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll excuse my saying, Doctor,&rdquo; pursued
Mr. Snitchey, &ldquo;having been already put a thousand
times in possession of my opinion, in the course of our
discussions, that, in its having gone to law, and in its
legal system altogether, I do observe a serious side&mdash;now,
really, a something tangible, and with a purpose
and intention in it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency Newcome made an angular tumble against
the table, occasioning a sounding clatter among the
cups and saucers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heyday! what&rsquo;s the matter there?&rdquo; exclaimed
the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this evil-inclined blue bag,&rdquo; said Clemency,
&ldquo;always tripping up somebody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a purpose and intention in it, I was
saying,&rdquo; resumed Snitchey, &ldquo;that commands respect.
Life a farce, Doctor Jeddler? With law in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor laughed, and looked at Alfred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted, if you please, that war is foolish,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Snitchey. &ldquo;There we agree. For example. Here&rsquo;s
a smiling country,&rdquo; pointing it out with his fork,
&ldquo;once overrun by soldiers&mdash;trespassers every man of
&rsquo;em&mdash;and laid waste by fire and sword. He, he, he!
The idea of any man exposing himself, voluntarily,
to fire and sword! Stupid, wasteful, positively
ridiculous; you laugh at your fellow-creatures, you
know, when you think of it! But take this smiling
country as it stands. Think of the laws appertaining
to real property; to the bequest and devise of
real property; to the mortgage and redemption of
real property; to leasehold, freehold, and copyhold
estate; think,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, with such great
emotion that he actually smacked his lips, &ldquo;of the
complicated laws relating to title and proof of title,
with all the contradictory precedents and numerous
acts of parliament connected with them; think
of the infinite number of ingenious and interminable
chancery suits, to which this pleasant prospect may
give rise;&mdash;and acknowledge, Doctor Jeddler, that
there is a green spot in the scheme about us! I
believe,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, looking at his partner,
&ldquo;that I speak for Self and Craggs?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Craggs having signified assent, Mr. Snitchey,
somewhat freshened by his recent eloquence, observed
that he would take a little more beef, and another
cup of tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t stand up for life in general,&rdquo; he added,
rubbing his hands and chuckling, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s full of folly;
full of something worse. Professions of trust, and
confidence, and unselfishness, and all that. Bah,
bah, bah! We see what they&rsquo;re worth. But you
mustn&rsquo;t laugh at life; you&rsquo;ve got a game to play; a
very serious game indeed! Everybody&rsquo;s playing
against you, you know; and you&rsquo;re playing against
them. Oh! it&rsquo;s a very interesting thing. There
are deep moves upon the board. You must only
laugh, Doctor Jeddler, when you win; and then not
much. He, he, he! And then not much,&rdquo; repeated
Snitchey, rolling his head and winking his eye; as if
he would have added, &lsquo;you may do this instead!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Alfred!&rdquo; cried the Doctor, &ldquo;what do you
say now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Sir,&rdquo; replied Alfred, &ldquo;that the greatest
favor you could do me, and yourself too I am inclined
to think, would be to try sometimes to forget this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
battle-field, and others like it, in that broader battle-field
of Life, on which the sun looks every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;m afraid that wouldn&rsquo;t soften his
opinions, Mr. Alfred,&rdquo; said Snitchey. &ldquo;The combatants
are very eager and very bitter in that same
battle of Life. There&rsquo;s a great deal of cutting and
slashing, and firing into people&rsquo;s heads from behind;
terrible treading down, and trampling on; it&rsquo;s rather
a bad business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe, Mr. Snitchey,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;there
are quiet victories and struggles, great sacrifices of
self, and noble acts of heroism, in it&mdash;even in many
of its apparent lightnesses and contradictions&mdash;not the
less difficult to achieve, because they have no earthly
chronicle or audience; done every day in nooks and
corners, and in little households, and in men&rsquo;s and
women&rsquo;s hearts&mdash;any one of which might reconcile
the sternest man to such a world, and fill him with
belief and hope in it, though two-fourths of its people
were at war, and another fourth at law; and that&rsquo;s
a bold word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the sisters listened keenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;I am too old to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be converted, even by my friend Snitchey here, or
my good spinster sister, Martha Jeddler; who had what
she calls her domestic trials ages ago, and has led a
sympathising life with all sorts of people ever since;
and who is so much of your opinion (only she&rsquo;s less
reasonable and more obstinate, being a woman), that
we can&rsquo;t agree, and seldom meet. I was born upon
this battle-field. I began, as a boy, to have my
thoughts directed to the real history of a battle-field.
Sixty years have gone over my head; and
I have never seen the Christian world, including
Heaven knows how many loving mothers and good
enough girls, like mine here, anything but mad
for a battle-field. The same contradictions prevail
in everything. One must either laugh or cry at
such stupendous inconsistencies; and I prefer to
laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Britain, who had been paying the profoundest and
most melancholy attention to each speaker in his
turn, seemed suddenly to decide in favor of the same
preference, if a deep sepulchral sound that escaped
him might be construed into a demonstration of risibility.
His face, however, was so perfectly unaffected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
by it, both before and afterwards, that although one
or two of the breakfast party looked round as being
startled by a mysterious noise, nobody connected the
offender with it.</p>

<p>Except his partner in attendance, Clemency Newcome;
who, rousing him with one of those favorite
joints, her elbows, inquired, in a reproachful whisper,
what he laughed at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you!&rdquo; said Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humanity,&rdquo; said Britain. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What between master and them lawyers, he&rsquo;s
getting more and more addle-headed every day!&rdquo; cried
Clemency, giving him a lunge with the other elbow,
as a mental stimulant. &ldquo;Do you know where you
are? Do you want to get warning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; said Britain, with a
leaden eye and an immovable visage. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care
for anything. I don&rsquo;t make out anything. I don&rsquo;t
believe anything. And I don&rsquo;t want anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although this forlorn summary of his general condition,
may have been overcharged in an access of
despondency, Benjamin Britain&mdash;sometimes called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Little Britain, to distinguish him from Great; as we
might say Young England, to express Old England with
a difference&mdash;had defined his real state more accurately
than might be supposed. For serving as a sort of
man Miles, to the Doctor&rsquo;s Friar Bacon; and listening
day after day to innumerable orations addressed
by the Doctor to various people, all tending to shew
that his very existence was at best a mistake and an
absurdity; this unfortunate servitor had fallen, by
degrees, into such an abyss of confused and contradictory
suggestions from within and without, that
Truth at the bottom of her well, was on the level
surface as compared with Britain in the depths of his
mystification. The only point he clearly comprehended,
was, that the new element usually brought
into these discussions by Snitchey and Craggs, never
served to make them clearer, and always seemed
to give the Doctor a species of advantage and confirmation.
Therefore he looked upon the Firm as
one of the proximate causes of his state of mind, and
held them in abhorrence accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is not our business, Alfred,&rdquo; said the
Doctor. &ldquo;Ceasing to be my ward (as you have said)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to-day; and leaving us full to the brim of such learning
as the Grammar School down here was able to
give you, and your studies in London could add to
that, and such practical knowledge as a dull old
country Doctor like myself could graft upon both;
you are away, now, into the world. The first term of
probation appointed by your poor father, being over,
away you go now, your own master, to fulfil his
second desire: and long before your three years&rsquo; tour
among the foreign schools of medicine is finished,
you&rsquo;ll have forgotten us. Lord, you&rsquo;ll forget us easily
in six months!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do&mdash;But you know better; why should I
speak to you!&rdquo; said Alfred, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything of the sort,&rdquo; returned the
Doctor. &ldquo;What do you say, Marion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marion, trifling with her teacup, seemed to say&mdash;but
she didn&rsquo;t say it&mdash;that he was welcome to forget
them, if he could. Grace pressed the blooming face
against her cheek, and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been, I hope, a very unjust steward
in the execution of my trust,&rdquo; pursued the Doctor;
&ldquo;but I am to be, at any rate, formally discharged, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
released, and what not, this morning; and here are
our good friends Snitchey and Craggs, with a bagful
of papers, and accounts, and documents, for the
transfer of the balance of the trust fund to you (I
wish it was a more difficult one to dispose of, Alfred,
but you must get to be a great man and make it so),
and other drolleries of that sort, which are to be
signed, sealed, and delivered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And duly witnessed, as by law required,&rdquo; said
Snitchey, pushing away his plate, and taking out the
papers, which his partner proceeded to spread upon
the table; &ldquo;and Self and Craggs having been
co-trustees with you, Doctor, in so far as the fund
was concerned, we shall want your two servants
to attest the signatures&mdash;can you read, Mrs.
Newcome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t married, Mister,&rdquo; said Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon. I should think not,&rdquo;
chuckled Snitchey, casting his eyes over her extraordinary
figure. &ldquo;You <em>can</em> read?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; answered Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marriage service, night and morning, eh?&rdquo;
observed the lawyer, jocosely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Clemency. &ldquo;Too hard. I only reads
a thimble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read a thimble!&rdquo; echoed Snitchey. &ldquo;What
are you talking about, young woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency nodded. &ldquo;And a nutmeg-grater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, this is a lunatic! a subject for the
Lord High Chancellor!&rdquo; said Snitchey, staring at
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If possessed of any property,&rdquo; stipulated Craggs.</p>

<p>Grace, however, interposing, explained that each
of the articles in question bore an engraved motto,
and so formed the pocket library of Clemency Newcome,
who was not much given to the study of books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it, Miss Grace!&rdquo; said Snitchey.
&ldquo;Yes, yes. Ha, ha, ha! I thought our friend was
an idiot. She looks uncommonly like it,&rdquo; he muttered,
with a supercilious glance. &ldquo;And what does the
thimble say, Mrs. Newcome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t married, Mister,&rdquo; observed Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Newcome. Will that do?&rdquo; said the
lawyer. &ldquo;What does the thimble say, Newcome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>How Clemency, before replying to this question,
held one pocket open, and looked down into its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
yawning depths for the thimble which wasn&rsquo;t there,&mdash;and
how she then held an opposite pocket open, and
seeming to descry it, like a pearl of great price, at
the bottom, cleared away such intervening obstacles
as a handkerchief, an end of wax candle, a flushed
apple, an orange, a lucky penny, a cramp bone, a
padlock, a pair of scissors in a sheath, more expressively
describable as promising young shears, a handful
or so of loose beads, several balls of cotton,
a needle-case, a cabinet collection of curl-papers,
and a biscuit, all of which articles she entrusted
individually and severally to Britain to hold,&mdash;is of no
consequence. Nor how, in her determination to grasp
this pocket by the throat and keep it prisoner (for it
had a tendency to swing and twist itself round the
nearest corner), she assumed, and calmly maintained,
an attitude apparently inconsistent with the human
anatomy and the laws of gravity. It is enough that
at last she triumphantly produced the thimble on her
finger, and rattled the nutmeg-grater; the literature
of both those trinkets being obviously in course of
wearing out and wasting away, through excessive
friction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thimble, is it, young woman?&rdquo; said
Mr. Snitchey, diverting himself at her expense.
&ldquo;And what does the thimble say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It says,&rdquo; replied Clemency, reading slowly round
it as if it were a tower, &ldquo;For-get and for-give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snitchey and Craggs laughed heartily. &ldquo;So
new!&rdquo; said Snitchey. &ldquo;So easy!&rdquo; said Craggs.
&ldquo;Such a knowledge of human nature in it,&rdquo; said
Snitchey. &ldquo;So applicable to the affairs of life,&rdquo; said
Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the nutmeg-grater?&rdquo; inquired the head of
the Firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grater says,&rdquo; returned Clemency, &ldquo;Do as
you&mdash;wold&mdash;be&mdash;done by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do, or you&rsquo;ll be done brown,&rsquo; you mean,&rdquo; said
Mr. Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; retorted Clemency, shaking
her head vaguely. &ldquo;I a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no lawyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that if she was, Doctor,&rdquo; said Mr.
Snitchey, turning to him suddenly, as if to anticipate
any effect that might otherwise be consequent on
this retort, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d find it to be the golden rule
of half her clients. They are serious enough in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that&mdash;whimsical as your world is&mdash;and lay the blame
on us afterwards. We, in our profession, are little
else than mirrors after all, Mr. Alfred; but we
are generally consulted by angry and quarrelsome
people, who are not in their best looks; and it&rsquo;s
rather hard to quarrel with us if we reflect unpleasant
aspects. I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, &ldquo;that I speak
for Self and Craggs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; said Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, if Mr. Britain will oblige us with a
mouthful of ink,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, returning to the
papers, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll sign, seal, and deliver as soon as possible,
or the coach will be coming past before we
know where we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If one might judge from his appearance, there was
every probability of the coach coming past before
Mr. Britain knew where <em>he</em> was; for he stood in a
state of abstraction, mentally balancing the Doctor
against the lawyers, and the lawyers against the
Doctor, and their clients against both; and engaged in
feeble attempts to make the thimble and nutmeg-grater
(a new idea to him) square with anybody&rsquo;s
system of philosophy; and, in short, bewildering himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
as much as ever his great namesake has done with
theories and schools. But Clemency, who was his
good Genius&mdash;though he had the meanest possible
opinion of her understanding, by reason of her seldom
troubling herself with abstract speculations, and being
always at hand to do the right thing at the right time&mdash;having
produced the ink in a twinkling, tendered
him the further service of recalling him to himself
by the application of her elbows; with which gentle
flappers she so jogged his memory, in a more literal
construction of that phrase than usual, that he soon
became quite fresh and brisk.</p>

<p>How he labored under an apprehension not
uncommon to persons in his degree, to whom the
use of pen and ink is an event, that he couldn&rsquo;t
append his name to a document, not of his own
writing, without committing himself in some shadowy
manner, or somehow signing away vague and enormous
sums of money; and how he approached the
deeds under protest, and by dint of the Doctor&rsquo;s
coercion, and insisted on pausing to look at them
before writing (the cramped hand, to say nothing of
the phraseology, being so much Chinese to him),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and also on turning them round to see whether there
was anything fraudulent, underneath; and how,
having signed his name, he became desolate as one
who had parted with his property and rights; I
want the time to tell. Also, how the blue bag containing
his signature, afterwards had a mysterious
interest for him, and he couldn&rsquo;t leave it; also, how
Clemency Newcome, in an ecstasy of laughter at the
idea of her own importance and dignity, brooded over
the whole table with her two elbows like a spread
eagle, and reposed her head upon her left arm as a
preliminary to the formation of certain cabalistic
characters, which required a deal of ink, and imaginary
counterparts whereof she executed at the same
time with her tongue. Also how, having once tasted
ink, she became thirsty in that regard, as tigers are
said to be after tasting another sort of fluid, and
wanted to sign everything, and put her name in all
kinds of places. In brief, the Doctor was discharged of
his trust and all its responsibilities; and Alfred, taking
it on himself, was fairly started on the journey of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Britain!&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;Run to the gate,
and watch for the coach. Time flies, Alfred!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir, yes,&rdquo; returned the young man, hurriedly.
&ldquo;Dear Grace! a moment! Marion&mdash;so young and
beautiful, so winning and so much admired, dear to
my heart as nothing else in life is&mdash;remember! I
leave Marion to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has always been a sacred charge to me,
Alfred. She is doubly so now. I will be faithful to
my trust, believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do believe it, Grace. I know it well. Who could
look upon your face, and hear your earnest voice, and
not know it! Ah, good Grace! If I had your well-governed
heart, and tranquil mind, how bravely I
would leave this place to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; she answered, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet, Grace&mdash;Sister, seems the natural
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use it!&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;I am glad to hear
it, call me nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet, Sister, then,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;Marion and
I had better have your true and stedfast qualities
serving us here, and making us both happier and
better. I wouldn&rsquo;t carry them away, to sustain myself,
if I could!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Coach upon the hill-top!&rdquo; exclaimed Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time flies, Alfred,&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>Marion had stood apart, with her eyes fixed upon
the ground; but this warning being given, her young
lover brought her tenderly to where her sister stood,
and gave her into her embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been telling Grace, dear Marion,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that you are her charge; my precious trust at parting.
And when I come back and reclaim you, dearest,
and the bright prospect of our married life lies
stretched before us, it shall be one of our chief pleasures
to consult how we can make Grace happy; how
we can anticipate her wishes; how we can show our
gratitude and love to her; how we can return her
something of the debt she will have heaped upon us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The younger sister had one hand in his; the other
rested on her sister&rsquo;s neck. She looked into that
sister&rsquo;s eyes, so calm, serene, and cheerful, with a
gaze in which affection, admiration, sorrow, wonder,
almost veneration, were blended. She looked into
that sister&rsquo;s face, as if it were the face of some bright
angel. Calm, serene, and cheerful, it looked back on
her and on her lover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And when the time comes, as it must one day,&rdquo;
said Alfred,&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder it has never come yet: but
Grace knows best, for Grace is always right,&mdash;when
<em>she</em> will want a friend to open her whole heart to,
and to be to her something of what she has been to
us,&mdash;then, Marion, how faithful we will prove,
and what delight to us to know that she, our dear
good sister, loves and is loved again, as we would
have her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still the younger sister looked into her eyes, and
turned not&mdash;even towards him. And still those honest
eyes looked back, so calm, serene, and cheerful, on
herself and on her lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when all that is past, and we are old, and
living (as we must!) together&mdash;close together; talking
often of old times,&rdquo; said Alfred&mdash;&ldquo;these shall be
our favorite times among them&mdash;this day most of all;
and telling each other what we thought and felt,
and hoped and feared, at parting; and how we couldn&rsquo;t
bear to say good bye&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coach coming through the wood,&rdquo; cried Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! I am ready&mdash;and how we met again, so
happily, in spite of all; we&rsquo;ll make this day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
happiest in all the year, and keep it as a treble birth-day.
Shall we, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; interposed the elder sister, eagerly, and
with a radiant smile. &ldquo;Yes! Alfred, don&rsquo;t linger.
There&rsquo;s no time. Say good bye to Marion. And
Heaven be with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pressed the younger sister to his heart. Released
from his embrace, she again clung to her sister;
and her eyes, with the same blended look, again
sought those so calm, serene, and cheerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell my boy!&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;To talk
about any serious correspondence or serious affections,
and engagements, and so forth, in such a&mdash;ha
ha ha!&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;why that, of
course, would be sheer nonsense. All I can say is,
that if you and Marion should continue in the same
foolish minds, I shall not object to have you for a
son-in-law one of these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the bridge!&rdquo; cried Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it come!&rdquo; said Alfred, wringing the Doctor&rsquo;s
hand stoutly. &ldquo;Think of me sometimes, my old
friend and guardian, as seriously as you can! Adieu,
Mr. Snitchey! Farewell, Mr. Craggs!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming down the road!&rdquo; cried Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A kiss of Clemency Newcome for long acquaintance'
sake&mdash;shake hands, Britain&mdash;Marion, dearest
heart, good bye! Sister Grace! remember!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quiet household figure, and the face so beautiful
in its serenity, were turned towards him in reply;
but Marion&rsquo;s look and attitude remained unchanged.</p>

<p>The coach was at the gate. There was a bustle
with the luggage. The coach drove away. Marion
never moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He waves his hat to you, my love,&rdquo; said Grace.
&ldquo;Your chosen husband, darling. Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The younger sister raised her head, and, for a
moment, turned it. Then turning back again, and
fully meeting, for the first time, those calm eyes, fell
sobbing on her neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grace. God bless you! But I cannot bear
to see it, Grace! It breaks my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Snitchey</span> and <span class="smcap">Craggs</span> had a snug
little office on the old Battle Ground,
where they drove a snug little business,
and fought a great many small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
pitched battles for a great many contending parties.
Though it could hardly be said of these conflicts that
they were running fights&mdash;for in truth they generally
proceeded at a snail&rsquo;s pace&mdash;the part the Firm had in
them came so far within that general denomination,
that now they took a shot at this Plaintiff, and
now aimed a chop at that Defendant, now made a
heavy charge at an estate in Chancery, and now had
some light skirmishing among an irregular body of
small debtors, just as the occasion served, and the
enemy happened to present himself. The Gazette
was an important and profitable feature in some of
their fields, as well as in fields of greater renown; and
in most of the Actions wherein they shewed their
generalship, it was afterwards observed by the combatants
that they had had great difficulty in making
each other out, or in knowing with any degree of
distinctness what they were about, in consequence of
the vast amount of smoke by which they were surrounded.</p>

<p>The offices of Messrs. Snitchey and Craggs stood convenient
with an open door, down two smooth steps in
the market-place: so that any angry farmer inclining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
towards hot water, might tumble into it at once.
Their special council-chamber and hall of conference
was an old back room up stairs, with a low dark
ceiling, which seemed to be knitting its brows gloomily
in the consideration of tangled points of law. It
was furnished with some high-backed leathern chairs,
garnished with great goggle-eyed brass nails, of which,
every here and there, two or three had fallen out;
or had been picked out, perhaps, by the wandering
thumbs and forefingers of bewildered clients. There
was a framed print of a great judge in it, every curl
in whose dreadful wig had made a man&rsquo;s hair stand on
end. Bales of papers filled the dusty closets, shelves,
and tables; and round the wainscoat there were tiers
of boxes, padlocked and fireproof, with people&rsquo;s names
painted outside, which anxious visitors felt themselves,
by a cruel enchantment, obliged to spell backwards
and forwards, and to make anagrams of, while they
sat, seeming to listen to Snitchey and Craggs, without
comprehending one word of what they said.</p>

<p>Snitchey and Craggs had each, in private life as in
professional existence, a partner of his own. Snitchey
and Craggs were the best friends in the world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
had a real confidence in one another; but Mrs.
Snitchey, by a dispensation not uncommon in the
affairs of life, was, on principle, suspicious of Mr.
Craggs, and Mrs. Craggs was, on principle, suspicious
of Mr. Snitchey. &ldquo;Your Snitcheys indeed,&rdquo; the
latter lady would observe, sometimes, to Mr. Craggs;
using that imaginative plural as if in disparagement
of an objectionable pair of pantaloons, or other articles
not possessed of a singular number; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
what you want with your Snitcheys, for my part.
You trust a great deal too much to your Snitcheys,
<em>I</em> think, and I hope you may never find my words
come true.&rdquo; While Mrs. Snitchey would observe to
Mr. Snitchey, of Craggs, &ldquo;that if ever he was led
away by man he was led away by that man; and that
if ever she read a double purpose in a mortal eye, she
read that purpose in Craggs&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo; Notwithstanding
this, however, they were all very good friends in
general: and Mrs. Snitchey and Mrs. Craggs maintained
a close bond of alliance against &ldquo;the office,&rdquo;
which they both considered a Blue chamber, and
common enemy, full of dangerous (because unknown)
machinations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>In this office, nevertheless, Snitchey and Craggs
made honey for their several hives. Here sometimes
they would linger, of a fine evening, at the window
of their council-chamber, overlooking the old battle-ground,
and wonder (but that was generally at assize
time, when much business had made them sentimental)
at the folly of mankind, who couldn&rsquo;t always
be at peace with one another, and go to law comfortably.
Here days, and weeks, and months, and years,
passed over them; their calendar, the gradually diminishing
number of brass nails in the leathern chairs,
and the increasing bulk of papers on the tables.
Here nearly three years&rsquo; flight had thinned the one
and swelled the other, since the breakfast in the
orchard; when they sat together in consultation, at
night.</p>

<p>Not alone; but with a man of thirty, or about
that time of life, negligently dressed, and somewhat
haggard in the face, but well-made, well-attired, and
well-looking, who sat in the arm-chair of state, with
one hand in his breast, and the other in his dishevelled
hair, pondering moodily. Messrs. Snitchey and
Craggs sat opposite each other at a neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
desk. One of the fire-proof boxes, unpadlocked and
opened, was upon it; a part
of its contents lay strewn upon the table,
and the rest was then in course of passing
through the hands of Mr. Snitchey,
who brought it to the candle, document
by document,
looked at every
paper singly, as he
produced
it, shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
his head, and handed it to Mr. Craggs, who looked it
over also, shook his head, and laid it down. Sometimes
they would stop, and shaking their heads in concert,
look towards the abstracted client; and the name on
the box being Michael Warden, Esquire, we may conclude
from these premises that the name and the box
were both his, and that the affairs of Michael Warden,
Esquire, were in a bad way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, turning up the
last paper. &ldquo;Really there&rsquo;s no other resource. No
other resource.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All lost, spent, wasted, pawned, borrowed and
sold, eh?&rdquo; said the client, looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All,&rdquo; returned Mr. Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing else to be done, you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The client bit his nails, and pondered again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am not even personally safe in England?
You hold to that; do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In no part of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; replied Mr. Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mere prodigal son with no father to go back to,
no swine to keep, and no husks to share with them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Eh?&rdquo; pursued the client, rocking one leg over the
other, and searching the ground with his eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Snitchey coughed, as if to deprecate the being
supposed to participate in any figurative illustration
of a legal position. Mr. Craggs, as if to express
that it was a partnership view of the subject, also
coughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruined at thirty!&rdquo; said the client. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not ruined, Mr. Warden,&rdquo; returned Snitchey.
&ldquo;Not so bad as that. You have done a good deal
towards it, I must say, but you are not ruined. A
little nursing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little Devil,&rdquo; said the client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craggs,&rdquo; said Snitchey, &ldquo;will you oblige
me with a pinch of snuff? Thank you, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the imperturbable lawyer applied it to his nose,
with great apparent relish and a perfect absorption
of his attention in the proceeding, the client gradually
broke into a smile, and, looking up, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk of nursing. How long nursing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long nursing?&rdquo; repeated Snitchey, dusting
the snuff from his fingers, and making a slow
calculation in his mind. &ldquo;For your involved estate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Sir? In good hands? S. and C.&rsquo;s, say? Six
or seven years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To starve for six or seven years!&rdquo; said the client
with a fretful laugh, and an impatient change of his
position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To starve for six or seven years, Mr. Warden,&rdquo;
said Snitchey, &ldquo;would be very uncommon indeed. You
might get another estate by shewing yourself, the
while. But we don&rsquo;t think you could do it&mdash;speaking
for Self and Craggs&mdash;and consequently don&rsquo;t
advise it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>do</em> you advise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nursing, I say,&rdquo; repeated Snitchey. &ldquo;Some
few years of nursing by Self and Craggs would bring
it round. But to enable us to make terms, and
hold terms, and you to keep terms, you must go
away, you must live abroad. As to starvation, we
could ensure you some hundreds a year to starve
upon, even in the beginning, I dare say, Mr.
Warden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hundreds,&rdquo; said the client. &ldquo;And I have
spent thousands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Snitchey, putting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
papers slowly back into the cast-iron box, &ldquo;there is
no doubt about. No doubt a&mdash;bout,&rdquo; he repeated to
himself, as he thoughtfully pursued his occupation.</p>

<p>The lawyer very likely knew his man; at any
rate his dry, shrewd, whimsical manner, had a
favourable influence upon the client&rsquo;s moody state,
and disposed him to be more free and unreserved.
Or perhaps the client knew <em>his</em> man; and had
elicited such encouragement as he had received,
to render some purpose he was about to disclose
the more defensible in appearance. Gradually raising
his head, he sat looking at his immovable
adviser with a smile, which presently broke into
a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my iron-headed friend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Snitchey pointed out his partner. &ldquo;Self and&mdash;excuse
me&mdash;Craggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg Mr. Craggs&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; said the client.
&ldquo;After all, my iron-headed friends,&rdquo; he leaned
forward in his chair, and dropped his voice a little,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know half my ruin yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Snitchey stopped and stared at him. Mr.
Craggs also stared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not only deep in debt,&rdquo; said the client
&ldquo;but I am deep in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in love!&rdquo; cried Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the client, falling back in his chair,
and surveying the Firm with his hands in his pockets.
&ldquo;Deep in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not with an heiress, Sir?&rdquo; said Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not with an heiress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor a rich lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor a rich lady that I know of&mdash;except in beauty
and merit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A single lady, I trust?&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, with
great expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not one of Doctor Jeddler&rsquo;s daughters?&rdquo;
said Snitchey, suddenly squaring his elbows on his
knees, and advancing his face at least a yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; returned the client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not his younger daughter?&rdquo; said Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; returned the client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craggs,&rdquo; said Snitchey, much relieved, &ldquo;will
you oblige me with another pinch of snuff? Thank
you. I am happy to say it don&rsquo;t signify, Mr. Warden;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
she&rsquo;s engaged, Sir, she&rsquo;s bespoke. My partner can
corroborate me. We know the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know the fact,&rdquo; repeated Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, so do I perhaps,&rdquo; returned the client
quietly. &ldquo;What of that? Are you men of the
world, and did you never hear of a woman changing
her mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There certainly have been actions for breach,&rdquo;
said Mr. Snitchey, &ldquo;brought against both spinsters
and widows, but in the majority of cases&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cases!&rdquo; interposed the client, impatiently.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of cases. The general precedent
is in a much larger volume than any of your law
books. Besides, do you think I have lived six weeks
in the Doctor&rsquo;s house for nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Sir,&rdquo; observed Mr. Snitchey, gravely
addressing himself to his partner, &ldquo;that of all the
scrapes Mr. Warden&rsquo;s horses have brought him into
at one time and another&mdash;and they have been pretty
numerous, and pretty expensive, as none know better
than himself and you and I&mdash;the worst scrape may
turn out to be, if he talks in this way, his having
been ever left by one of them at the Doctor&rsquo;s garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
wall, with three broken ribs, a snapped collar-bone, and
the Lord knows how many bruises. We didn&rsquo;t think
so much of it, at the time when we knew he was
going on well under the Doctor&rsquo;s hands and roof; but
it looks bad now, Sir. Bad! It looks very bad.
Doctor Jeddler too&mdash;our client, Mr. Craggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Alfred Heathfield too&mdash;a sort of client, Mr.
Snitchey,&rdquo; said Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Michael Warden too, a kind of client,&rdquo; said
the careless visitor, &ldquo;and no bad one either: having
played the fool for ten or twelve years. However
Mr. Michael Warden has sown his wild oats now;
there&rsquo;s their crop, in that box; and means to repent
and be wise. And in proof of it, Mr. Michael
Warden means, if he can, to marry Marion, the
Doctor&rsquo;s lovely daughter, and to carry her away with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Mr. Craggs,&rdquo; Snitchey began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really Mr. Snitchey, and Mr. Craggs, partners
both,&rdquo; said the client, interrupting him; &ldquo;you
know your duty to your clients, and you know
well enough, I am sure, that it is no part of it to
interfere in a mere love affair, which I am obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
confide to you. I am not going to carry the young
lady off, without her own consent. There&rsquo;s nothing
illegal in it. I never was Mr. Heathfield&rsquo;s bosom
friend. I violate no confidence of his. I love where
he loves, and I mean to win where he would win, if I
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t, Mr. Craggs,&rdquo; said Snitchey, evidently
anxious and discomfited. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do it, Sir.
She dotes on Mr. Alfred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she?&rdquo; returned the client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craggs, she dotes on him, Sir,&rdquo; persisted
Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t live six weeks, some few months ago, in
the Doctor&rsquo;s house for nothing; and I doubted that
soon,&rdquo; observed the client. &ldquo;She would have doted
on him, if her sister could have brought it about; but
I watched them. Marion avoided his name, avoided
the subject: shrunk from the least allusion to it, with
evident distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should she, Mr. Craggs, you know? Why
should she, Sir?&rdquo; inquired Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why she should, though there are
many likely reasons,&rdquo; said the client, smiling at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
attention and perplexity expressed in Mr. Snitchey&rsquo;s
shining eye, and at his cautious way of carrying on
the conversation, and making himself informed upon
the subject; &ldquo;but I know she does. She was very
young when she made the engagement&mdash;if it may be
called one, I am not even sure of that&mdash;and has
repented of it, perhaps. Perhaps&mdash;it seems a foppish
thing to say, but upon my soul I don&rsquo;t mean it in
that light&mdash;she may have fallen in love with me, as I
have fallen in love with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He, he! Mr. Alfred, her old playfellow too, you
remember, Mr. Craggs,&rdquo; said Snitchey, with a disconcerted
laugh; &ldquo;knew her almost from a baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which makes it the more probable that she may
be tired of his idea,&rdquo; calmly pursued the client, &ldquo;and
not indisposed to exchange it for the newer one of
another lover, who presents himself (or is presented
by his horse) under romantic circumstances; has the
not unfavorable reputation&mdash;with a country girl&mdash;of
having lived thoughtlessly and gaily, without doing
much harm to anybody; and who, for his youth and
figure, and so forth&mdash;this may seem foppish again,
but upon my soul I don&rsquo;t mean it in that light&mdash;might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
perhaps pass muster in a crowd with Mr.
Alfred himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying the last clause, certainly;
and Mr. Snitchey, glancing at him, thought so.
There was something naturally graceful and pleasant
in the very carelessness of his air. It seemed to
suggest, of his comely face and well-knit figure, that
they might be greatly better if he chose: and that,
once roused and made earnest (but he never had been
earnest yet), he could be full of fire and purpose. &ldquo;A
dangerous sort of libertine,&rdquo; thought the shrewd
lawyer, &ldquo;to seem to catch the spark he wants from
a young lady&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, observe, Snitchey,&rdquo; he continued, rising
and taking him by the button, &ldquo;and Craggs,&rdquo; taking
him by the button also, and placing one partner on
either side of him, so that neither might evade him.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you for any advice. You are right to
keep quite aloof from all parties in such a matter,
which is not one in which grave men like you could
interfere, on any side. I am briefly going to review
in half-a-dozen words, my position and intention, and
then I shall leave it to you to do the best for me, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
money matters, that you can: seeing, that, if I run
away with the Doctor&rsquo;s beautiful daughter (as I hope
to do, and to become another man under her bright
influence), it will be, for the moment, more chargeable
than running away alone. But I shall soon make
all that up in an altered life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it will be better not to hear this, Mr.
Craggs?&rdquo; said Snitchey, looking at him across the
client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> think not,&rdquo; said Craggs.&mdash;Both listening
attentively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! You needn&rsquo;t hear it,&rdquo; replied their client.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention it, however. I don&rsquo;t mean to ask the
Doctor&rsquo;s consent, because he wouldn&rsquo;t give it me.
But I mean to do the Doctor no wrong or harm,
because (besides there being nothing serious in such
trifles, as he says) I hope to rescue his child, my
Marion, from what I see&mdash;I <em>know</em>&mdash;she dreads, and
contemplates with misery: that is, the return of this
old lover. If anything in the world is true, it is true
that she dreads his return. Nobody is injured so
far. I am so harried and worried here just now,
that I lead the life of a flying-fish; skulk about in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
dark, am shut out of my own house, and warned off
my own grounds: but that house, and those grounds,
and many an acre besides, will come back to me one
day, as you know and say; and Marion will probably
be richer&mdash;on your showing, who are never sanguine&mdash;ten
years hence as my wife, than as the wife of
Alfred Heathfield, whose return she dreads (remember
that), and in whom or in any man, my passion is
not surpassed. Who is injured yet? It is a fair
case throughout. My right is as good as his, if she
decide in my favor; and I will try my right by her
alone. You will like to know no more after this,
and I will tell you no more. Now you know my purpose,
and wants. When must I leave here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a week,&rdquo; said Snitchey. &ldquo;Mr. Craggs?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In something less, I should say,&rdquo; responded
Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a month,&rdquo; said the client, after attentively
watching the two faces. &ldquo;This day month. To-day
is Thursday. Succeed or fail, on this day month
I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too long a delay,&rdquo; said Snitchey; &ldquo;much
too long. But let it be so. I thought he&rsquo;d have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
stipulated for three,&rdquo; he murmured to himself. &ldquo;Are
you going? Good night, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; returned the client, shaking hands
with the Firm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll live to see me making a good
use of riches yet. Henceforth, the star of my destiny
is, Marion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of the stairs, Sir,&rdquo; replied Snitchey;
&ldquo;for she don&rsquo;t shine there. Good night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they both stood at the stair-head with a pair of
office-candles, watching him down; and when he had
gone away, stood looking at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of all this, Mr. Craggs?&rdquo;
said Snitchey.</p>

<p>Mr. Craggs shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was our opinion, on the day when that release
was executed, that there was something curious in
the parting of that pair, I recollect,&rdquo; said Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Mr. Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he deceives himself altogether,&rdquo; pursued
Mr. Snitchey, locking up the fireproof box, and
putting it away; &ldquo;or if he don&rsquo;t, a little bit of fickleness
and perfidy is not a miracle, Mr. Craggs. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
yet I thought that pretty face was very true. I
thought,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, putting on his great coat,
(for the weather was very cold), drawing on his gloves,
and snuffing out one candle, &ldquo;that I had even seen
her character becoming stronger and more resolved of
late. More like her sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Craggs was of the same opinion,&rdquo; returned
Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really give a trifle to-night,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Snitchey, who was a good-natured man, &ldquo;if I could
believe that Mr. Warden was reckoning without his
host; but light-headed, capricious, and unballasted
as he is, he knows something of the world and its
people (he ought to, for he has bought what he does
know, dear enough); and I can&rsquo;t quite think that. We
had better not interfere: we can do nothing, Mr.
Craggs, but keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; returned Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our friend the Doctor makes light of such things,&rdquo;
said Mr. Snitchey, shaking his head. &ldquo;I hope he
mayn&rsquo;t stand in need of his philosophy. Our friend
Alfred talks of the battle of life,&rdquo; he shook his head
again, &ldquo;I hope he mayn&rsquo;t be cut down early in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
day. Have you got your hat, Mr. Craggs? I am
going to put the other candle out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr Craggs replying in the affirmative, Mr. Snitchey
suited the action to the word, and they groped their
way out of the council-chamber: now as dark as the
subject, or the law in general.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My story passes to a quiet little study, where, on
that same night, the sisters and the hale old Doctor
sat by a cheerful fire-side. Grace was working at
her needle. Marion read aloud from a book before
her. The Doctor, in his dressing-gown and slippers,
with his feet spread out upon the warm rug, leaned
back in his easy chair, and listened to the book, and
looked upon his daughters.</p>

<p>They were very beautiful to look upon. Two better
faces for a fireside, never made a fireside bright and
sacred. Something of the difference between them
had been softened down in three years&rsquo; time; and
enthroned upon the clear brow of the younger sister,
looking through her eyes, and thrilling in her voice,
was the same earnest nature that her own motherless
youth had ripened in the elder sister long ago. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
she still appeared at once the lovelier and weaker of
the two; still seemed to rest her head upon her sister&rsquo;s
breast, and put her trust in her, and look into her
eyes for counsel and reliance. Those loving eyes,
so calm, serene, and cheerful, as of old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And being in her own home,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Marion,
from the book; &ldquo;&lsquo;her home made exquisitely dear by
these remembrances, she now began to know that the
great trial of her heart must soon come on, and could
not be delayed. Oh Home, our comforter and friend
when others fall away, to part with whom, at any step
between the cradle and the grave&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marion, my love!&rdquo; said Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Puss!&rdquo; exclaimed her father, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her hand upon the hand her sister stretched
towards her, and read on; her voice still faltering
and trembling, though she made an effort to command
it when thus interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To part with whom, at any step between the
cradle and the grave, is always sorrowful. Oh
Home, so true to us, so often slighted in return, be
lenient to them that turn away from thee, and do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
haunt their erring footsteps too reproachfully! Let
no kind looks, no well-remembered smiles, be seen
upon thy phantom face. Let no ray of affection,
welcome, gentleness, forbearance, cordiality, shine
from thy white head. Let no old loving word or tone
rise up in judgment against thy deserter; but if
thou canst look harshly and severely, do, in mercy to
the Penitent!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Marion, read no more to-night,&rdquo; said Grace&mdash;for
she was weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she replied, and closed the book.
&ldquo;The words seem all on fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor was amused at this; and laughed as he
patted her on the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! overcome by a story-book!&rdquo; said Doctor
Jeddler. &ldquo;Print and paper! Well, well, it&rsquo;s all
one. It&rsquo;s as rational to make a serious matter of
print and paper as of anything else. But dry your
eyes, love, dry your eyes. I dare say the heroine
has got home again long ago, and made it up all
round&mdash;and if she hasn&rsquo;t, a real home is only four
walls; and a fictitious one, mere rags and ink.
What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me, Mister,&rdquo; said Clemency, putting in
her head at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the matter with <em>you</em>?&rdquo; said the
Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bless you, nothing an&rsquo;t the matter with me,&rdquo;
returned Clemency&mdash;and truly too, to judge from her
well-soaped face, in which there gleamed as usual
the very soul of good humour, which, ungainly as she
was, made her quite engaging. Abrasions on the
elbows are not generally understood, it is true, to
range within that class of personal charms called
beauty-spots. But it is better, going through the
world, to have the arms chafed in that narrow
passage, than the temper: and Clemency&rsquo;s was sound
and whole as any beauty&rsquo;s in the land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing an&rsquo;t the matter with me,&rdquo; said Clemency,
entering, &ldquo;but&mdash;come a little closer, Mister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor, in some astonishment, complied with
this invitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said I wasn&rsquo;t to give you one before them,
you know,&rdquo; said Clemency.</p>

<p>A novice in the family might have supposed, from
her extraordinary ogling as she said it, as well as from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a singular rapture or ecstasy which pervaded her
elbows, as if she were embracing herself, that &lsquo;one,&rsquo;
in its most favorable interpretation, meant a chaste
salute. Indeed the Doctor himself seemed alarmed,
for the moment; but quickly regained his composure,
as Clemency, having had recourse to both her pockets&mdash;beginning
with the right one, going away to the
wrong one, and afterwards coming back to the right
one again&mdash;produced a letter from the Post-office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Britain was riding by on a errand,&rdquo; she chuckled,
handing it to the Doctor, &ldquo;and see the Mail come in,
and waited for it. There&rsquo;s A.&nbsp;H. in the corner.
Mr. Alfred&rsquo;s on his journey home, I bet. We shall
have a wedding in the house&mdash;there was two spoons
in my saucer this morning. Oh Luck, how slow he
opens it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this she delivered, by way of soliloquy, gradually
rising higher and higher on tiptoe, in her impatience
to hear the news, and making a corkscrew of
her apron, and a bottle of her mouth. At last,
arriving at a climax of suspense, and seeing the
Doctor still engaged in the perusal of the letter, she
came down flat upon the soles of her feet again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
cast her apron, as a veil, over her head, in a mute
despair, and inability to bear it any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Girls!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
help it: I never could keep a secret in my life. There
are not many secrets, indeed, worth being kept in
such a&mdash;well! never mind that. Alfred&rsquo;s coming
home, my dears, directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Directly!&rdquo; exclaimed Marion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! The story-book is soon forgotten!&rdquo; said
the Doctor, pinching her cheek. &ldquo;I thought the news
would dry those tears. Yes. &lsquo;Let it be a surprise,&rsquo;
he says, here. But I can&rsquo;t let it be a surprise.
He must have a welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Directly!&rdquo; repeated Marion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, perhaps not what your impatience calls
&lsquo;directly,&rsquo;&rdquo; returned the Doctor; &ldquo;but pretty soon
too. Let us see. Let us see. To-day is Thursday,
is it not? Then he promises to be here, this day
month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This day month!&rdquo; repeated Marion, softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gay day and a holiday for us,&rdquo; said the cheerful
voice of her sister Grace, kissing her in congratulation.
&ldquo;Long looked forward to, dearest, and come at last.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>She answered with a smile; a mournful smile, but
full of sisterly affection: and as she looked in her
sister&rsquo;s face, and listened to the quiet music of her
voice, picturing the happiness of this return, her own
face glowed with hope and joy.</p>

<p>And with a something else: a something shining
more and more through all the rest of its expression:
for which I have no name. It was not exultation,
triumph, proud enthusiasm. They are not so calmly
shown. It was not love and gratitude alone, though
love and gratitude were part of it. It emanated from
no sordid thought, for sordid thoughts do not light up
the brow, and hover on the lips, and move the spirit,
like a fluttered light, until the sympathetic figure
trembles.</p>

<p>Doctor Jeddler, in spite of his system of philosophy&mdash;which
he was continually contradicting and denying
in practice, but more famous philosophers have done
that&mdash;could not help having as much interest in the
return of his old ward and pupil, as if it had been a
serious event. So he sat himself down in his easy
chair again, stretched out his slippered feet once
more upon the rug, read the letter over and over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
great many times, and talked it over more times
still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! The day was,&rdquo; said the Doctor, looking at
the fire, &ldquo;when you and he, Grace, used to trot about
arm-in-arm, in his holiday time, like a couple of
walking dolls. You remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; she answered, with her pleasant
laugh, and plying her needle busily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This day month, indeed!&rdquo; mused the Doctor.
&ldquo;That hardly seems a twelve-month ago. And
where was my little Marion then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never far from her sister,&rdquo; said Marion, cheerily,
&ldquo;however little. Grace was everything to me, even
when she was a young child herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, Puss, true,&rdquo; returned the Doctor. &ldquo;She
was a staid little woman, was Grace, and a wise
housekeeper, and a busy, quiet, pleasant body; bearing
with our humours and anticipating our wishes,
and always ready to forget her own, even in those
times. I never knew you positive or obstinate,
Grace, my darling, even then, on any subject but
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have changed sadly for the worse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
since,&rdquo; laughed Grace, still busy at her work.
&ldquo;What was that one, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alfred, of course,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;Nothing
would serve you but you must be called Alfred&rsquo;s wife;
so we called you Alfred&rsquo;s wife; and you liked it better,
I believe (odd as it seems now), than being called a
Duchess, if we could have made you one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Grace, placidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo; inquired the
Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I remember something of it,&rdquo; she returned,
&ldquo;but not much. It&rsquo;s so long ago.&rdquo; And as
she sat at work, she hummed the burden of an old
song, which the Doctor liked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alfred will find a real wife soon,&rdquo; she said,
breaking off; &ldquo;and that will be a happy time indeed
for all of us. My three years&rsquo; trust is nearly at an
end, Marion. It has been a very easy one. I shall
tell Alfred, when I give you back to him, that you
have loved him dearly all the time, and that he has
never once needed my good services. May I tell him
so, love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him, dear Grace,&rdquo; replied Marion, &ldquo;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
there never was a trust so generously, nobly, stedfastly
discharged; and that I have loved <em>you</em>, all the
time, dearer and dearer every day; and oh! how
dearly now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said her cheerful sister, returning her
embrace, &ldquo;I can scarcely tell him that; we will
leave my deserts to Alfred&rsquo;s imagination. It will be
liberal enough, dear Marion; like your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that she resumed the work she had for a
moment laid down, when her sister spoke so fervently:
and with it the old song the Doctor liked to hear.
And the Doctor, still reposing in his easy chair, with
his slippered feet stretched out before him on the rug,
listened to the tune, and beat time on his knee with
Alfred&rsquo;s letter, and looked at his two daughters, and
thought that among the many trifles of the trifling
world, these trifles were agreeable enough.</p>

<p>Clemency Newcome in the mean time, having
accomplished her mission and lingered in the room
until she had made herself a party to the news,
descended to the kitchen, where her coadjutor, Mr.
Britain, was regaling after supper, surrounded by such
a plentiful collection of bright pot-lids, well-scoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
saucepans, burnished dinner-covers, gleaming kettles,
and other tokens of her industrious habits, arranged
upon the walls and shelves, that he sat as in the
centre of a hall of mirrors. The majority did not
give forth very flattering portraits of him, certainly;
nor were they by any means unanimous in their
reflections; as some made him very long-faced, others
very broad-faced, some tolerably well-looking, others
vastly ill-looking, according to their several manners
of reflecting: which were as various, in respect of one
fact, as those of so many kinds of men. But they all
agreed that in the midst of them sat, quite at his
ease, an individual with a pipe in his mouth, and a
jug of beer at his elbow, who nodded condescendingly
to Clemency, when she stationed herself at the same
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Clemmy,&rdquo; said Britain, &ldquo;how are you by
this time, and what&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency told him the news, which he received
very graciously. A gracious change had come over
Benjamin from head to foot. He was much broader,
much redder, much more cheerful, and much jollier in
all respects. It seemed as if his face had been tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
up in a knot before, and was now untwisted and
smoothed out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be another job for Snitchey and Craggs,
I suppose,&rdquo; he observed, puffing slowly at his pipe.
&ldquo;More witnessing for you and me, perhaps, Clemmy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor!&rdquo; replied his fair companion, with her
favorite twist of her favorite joints. &ldquo;I wish it was
me, Britain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish what was you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A going to be married,&rdquo; said Clemency.</p>

<p>Benjamin took his pipe out of his mouth and
laughed heartily. &ldquo;Yes! you&rsquo;re a likely subject for
that!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Poor Clem!&rdquo; Clemency for her
part laughed as heartily as he, and seemed as much
amused by the idea. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
likely subject for that; an&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em>&rsquo;ll never be married, you know,&rdquo; said Mr.
Britain, resuming his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I ever shall though?&rdquo; said Clemency,
in perfect good faith.</p>

<p>Mr. Britain shook his head. &ldquo;Not a chance
of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only think!&rdquo; said Clemency. &ldquo;Well!&mdash;I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
you mean to, Britain, one of these days; don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A question so abrupt, upon a subject so momentous,
required consideration. After blowing out a great
cloud of smoke, and looking at it with his head now
on this side and now on that, as if it were actually the
question, and he were surveying it in various aspects,
Mr. Britain replied that he wasn&rsquo;t altogether clear
about it, but&mdash;ye-es&mdash;he thought he might come to
that at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish her joy, whoever she may be!&rdquo; cried
Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh she&rsquo;ll have that,&rdquo; said Benjamin; &ldquo;safe
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she wouldn&rsquo;t have led quite such a joyful life
as she will lead, and wouldn&rsquo;t have had quite such a
sociable sort of husband as she will have,&rdquo; said Clemency,
spreading herself half over the table, and
staring retrospectively at the candle, &ldquo;if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for&mdash;not that I went to do it, for it was accidental,
I am sure&mdash;if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me; now
would she, Britain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; returned Mr. Britain, by this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in that high state of appreciation of his pipe, when a
man can open his mouth but a very little way for
speaking purposes; and sitting luxuriously immovable
in his chair, can afford to turn only his eyes towards a
companion, and that very passively and gravely.
&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m greatly beholden to you, you know, Clem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor, how nice that is to think of!&rdquo; said Clemency.</p>

<p>At the same time, bringing her thoughts as well
as her sight to bear upon the candle-grease, and
becoming abruptly reminiscent of its healing qualities
as a balsam, she anointed her left elbow with a
plentiful application of that remedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see I&rsquo;ve made a good many investigations
of one sort and another in my time,&rdquo; pursued Mr.
Britain, with the profundity of a sage; &ldquo;having been
always of an inquiring turn of mind; and I&rsquo;ve read
a good many books about the general Rights of things
and Wrongs of things, for I went into the literary
line myself, when I began life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you though!&rdquo; cried the admiring Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain; &ldquo;I was hid for the best
part of two years behind a bookstall, ready to fly out if
anybody pocketed a volume; and after that I was light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
porter to a stay and mantua maker, in which capacity
I was employed to carry about, in oilskin baskets,
nothing but deceptions&mdash;which soured my spirits and
disturbed my confidence in human nature; and after
that, I heard a world of discussions in this house,
which soured my spirits fresh; and my opinion after
all is, that, as a safe and comfortable sweetener of the
same, and as a pleasant guide through life, there&rsquo;s
nothing like a nutmeg-grater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency was about to offer a suggestion, but he
stopped her by anticipating it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Com-bined,&rdquo; he added gravely, &ldquo;with a thimble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as you wold, you know, and cetrer, eh!&rdquo;
observed Clemency, folding her arms comfortably in
her delight at this avowal, and patting her elbows.
&ldquo;Such a short cut, an&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s
what would be considered good philosophy. I&rsquo;ve my
doubts about that: but it wears well, and saves a
quantity of snarling, which the genuine article don&rsquo;t
always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See how you used to go on once, yourself, you
know!&rdquo; said Clemency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Britain. &ldquo;But the most extraordinary
thing, Clemmy, is that I should live to be
brought round, through you. That&rsquo;s the strange part
of it. Through you! Why, I suppose you haven&rsquo;t
so much as half an idea in your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency, without taking the least offence, shook
it, and laughed, and hugged herself, and said, &ldquo;No,
she didn&rsquo;t suppose she had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I dare say you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Clemency.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to none. I don&rsquo;t want any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benjamin took his pipe from his lips, and laughed
till the tears ran down his face. &ldquo;What a natural
you are, Clemmy!&rdquo; he said, shaking his head, with an
infinite relish of the joke, and wiping his eyes.
Clemency, without the smallest inclination to dispute
it, did the like, and laughed as heartily as he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help liking you,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a regular good creature in your way; so
shake hands, Clem. Whatever happens, I&rsquo;ll always
take notice of you, and be a friend to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; returned Clemency. &ldquo;Well! that&rsquo;s
very good of you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain, giving her his pipe
to knock the ashes out of; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand by you.
Hark! That&rsquo;s a curious noise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noise!&rdquo; repeated Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A footstep outside. Somebody dropping from
the wall, it sounded like,&rdquo; said Britain. &ldquo;Are they
all abed up-stairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, all abed by this time,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They both listened, but heard nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; said Benjamin, taking down a
lantern. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look round before I go to bed
myself, for satisfaction&rsquo;s sake. Undo the door while I
light this, Clemmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency complied briskly; but observed as she did
so, that he would only have his walk for his pains, that
it was all his fancy, and so forth. Mr. Britain said
&lsquo;very likely;&rsquo; but sallied out, nevertheless, armed with
the poker, and casting the light of the lantern far
and near in all directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as quiet as a churchyard,&rdquo; said Clemency,
looking after him; &ldquo;and almost as ghostly too!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing back into the kitchen, she cried fearfully,
as a light figure stole into her view, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Marion, in an agitated whisper.
&ldquo;You have always loved me, have you not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loved you, child! You may be sure I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure. And I may trust you, may I not?
There is no one else just now, in whom I <em>can</em> trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clemency, with all her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is some one out there,&rdquo; pointing to the
door, &ldquo;whom I must see, and speak with, to-night.
Michael Warden, for God&rsquo;s sake retire! Not now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency started with surprise and trouble as, following
the direction of the speaker&rsquo;s eyes, she saw a
dark figure standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In another moment you may be discovered,&rdquo;
said Marion. &ldquo;Not now! Wait, if you can, in
some concealment. I will come, presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waved his hand to her, and was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to bed. Wait here for me!&rdquo; said
Marion, hurriedly. &ldquo;I have been seeking to speak
to you for an hour past. Oh, be true to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagerly seizing her bewildered hand, and pressing
it with both her own to her breast&mdash;an action more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
expressive, in its passion of entreaty, than the most
eloquent appeal in words,&mdash;Marion withdrew; as the
light of the returning lantern flashed into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All still and peaceable. Nobody there. Fancy,
I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain, as he locked and barred
the door. &ldquo;One of the effects of having a lively
imagination. Halloa! Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency, who could not conceal the effects of her
surprise and concern, was sitting in a chair: pale,
and trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter!&rdquo; she repeated, chafing her hands and
elbows, nervously, and looking anywhere but at him.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good in you, Britain, that is! After going
and frightening one out of one&rsquo;s life with noises, and
lanterns, and I don&rsquo;t know what all. Matter! Oh,
yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re frightened out of your life by a lantern,
Clemmy,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain, composedly blowing it
out and hanging it up again, &ldquo;that apparition&rsquo;s very
soon got rid of. But you&rsquo;re as bold as brass in
general,&rdquo; he said, stopping to observe her; &ldquo;and
were, after the noise and the lantern too. What have
you taken into your head? Not an idea, eh?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>But as Clemency bade him good night very much
after her usual fashion, and began to bustle about
with a show of going to bed herself immediately,
Little Britain, after giving utterance to the original
remark that it was impossible to account for a woman&rsquo;s
whims, bade her good night in return, and taking
up his candle strolled drowsily away to bed.</p>

<p>When all was quiet, Marion returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and stand there
close beside me, while I speak to him, outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Timid as her manner was, it still evinced a resolute
and settled purpose, such as Clemency could not
resist. She softly unbarred the door: but before
turning the key, looked round on the young creature
waiting to issue forth when she should open it.</p>

<p>The face was not averted or cast down, but looking
full upon her, in its pride of youth and beauty.
Some simple sense of the slightness of the barrier
that interposed itself between the happy home and
honoured love of the fair girl, and what might be the
desolation of that home, and shipwreck of its dearest
treasure, smote so keenly on the tender heart of
Clemency, and so filled it to overflowing with sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and compassion, that, bursting into tears, she threw
her arms round Marion&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little that I know, my dear,&rdquo; cried Clemency,
&ldquo;very little; but I know that this should not be.
Think of what you do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought of it many times,&rdquo; said Marion,
gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; urged Clemency. &ldquo;Till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marion shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Mr. Alfred&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Clemency, with
homely earnestness. &ldquo;Him that you used to love so
dearly, once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hid her face, upon the instant, in her hands,
repeating &ldquo;Once!&rdquo; as if it rent her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go out,&rdquo; said Clemency, soothing her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him what you like. Don&rsquo;t cross the door-step
to-night. I&rsquo;m sure no good will come of it.
Oh, it was an unhappy day when Mr. Warden was ever
brought here! Think of your good father, darling:
of your sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Marion, hastily raising her head.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I do. You don&rsquo;t know what
I do. I <em>must</em> speak to him. You are the best and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
truest friend in all the world for what you have
said to me, but I must take
this step. Will you go
with me, Clemency,&rdquo;
she kissed her on
her friendly face,
&ldquo;or shall I go
alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Sorrowing and wondering, Clemency turned the
key, and opened the door. Into the dark and doubtful
night that lay beyond the threshhold, Marion
passed quickly, holding by her hand.</p>

<p>In the dark night he joined her, and they spoke
together earnestly and long: and the hand that held
so fast by Clemency&rsquo;s, now trembled, now turned
deadly cold, now clasped and closed on hers, in the
strong feeling of the speech it emphasized unconsciously.
When they returned, he followed to the door;
and pausing there a moment, seized the other hand,
and pressed it to his lips. Then stealthily withdrew.</p>

<p>The door was barred and locked again, and once
again she stood beneath her father&rsquo;s roof. Not bowed
down by the secret that she brought there, though
so young; but with that same expression on her face,
for which I had no name before, and shining through
her tears.</p>

<p>Again she thanked and thanked her humble friend,
and trusted to her, as she said, with confidence, implicitly.
Her chamber safely reached, she fell upon
her knees; and with her secret weighing on her heart,
could pray!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Could rise up from her prayers, so tranquil and
serene, and bending over her fond sister in her
slumber, look upon her face and smile: though sadly:
murmuring as she kissed her forehead, how that
Grace had been a mother to her, ever, and she loved
her as a child!</p>

<p>Could draw the passive arm about her neck when
lying down to rest&mdash;it seemed to cling there, of its
own will, protectingly and tenderly even in sleep&mdash;and
breathe upon the parted lips, God bless her!</p>

<p>Could sink into a peaceful sleep, herself; but for one
dream, in which she cried out, in her innocent and
touching voice, that she was quite alone, and they had
all forgotten her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A month soon passes, even at its tardiest pace.
The month appointed to elapse between that night
and the return, was quick of foot, and went by, like
a vapour.</p>

<p>The day arrived. A raging winter day, that shook
the old house, sometimes, as if it shivered in the blast.
A day to make home doubly home. To give the
chimney corner new delights. To shed a ruddier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
glow upon the faces gathered round the hearth;
and draw each fireside group into a closer and
more social league, against the roaring elements
without. Such a wild winter day as best prepares
the way for shut-out night; for curtained rooms,
and cheerful looks; for music, laughter, dancing,
light, and jovial entertainment!</p>

<p>All these the Doctor had in store to welcome Alfred
back. They knew that he could not arrive till night;
and they would make the night air ring, he said, as
he approached. All his old friends should congregate
about him. He should not miss a face that he had
known and liked. No! They should every one be
there!</p>

<p>So, guests were bidden, and musicians were
engaged, and tables spread, and floors prepared for
active feet, and bountiful provision made, of every
hospitable kind. Because it was the Christmas season,
and his eyes were all unused to English holly, and its
sturdy green, the dancing room was garlanded and
hung with it; and the red berries gleamed an
English welcome to him, peeping from among the
leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a busy day for all of them: a busier day for
none of them than Grace, who noiselessly presided
everywhere, and was the cheerful mind of all the preparations.
Many a time that day (as well as many
a time within the fleeting month preceding it), did
Clemency glance anxiously, and almost fearfully, at
Marion. She saw her paler, perhaps, than usual; but
there was a sweet composure on her face that made it
lovelier than ever.</p>

<p>At night when she was dressed, and wore upon her
head a wreath that Grace had proudly twined about
it&mdash;its mimic flowers were Alfred&rsquo;s favorites, as Grace
remembered when she chose them&mdash;that old expression,
pensive, almost sorrowful, and yet so spiritual,
high, and stirring, sat again upon her brow, enhanced
a hundred fold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next wreath I adjust on this fair head, will
be a marriage wreath,&rdquo; said Grace; &ldquo;or I am no true
prophet, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her sister smiled, and held her in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A moment, Grace. Don&rsquo;t leave me yet. Are
you sure that I want nothing more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her care was not for that. It was her sister&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
face she thought of, and her eyes were fixed upon it,
tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My art,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;can go no farther, dear
girl; nor your beauty. I never saw you look so
beautiful as now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never was so happy,&rdquo; she returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, but there is greater happiness in store. In
such another home, as cheerful and as bright as this
looks now,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;Alfred and his young wife
will soon be living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled again. &ldquo;It is a happy home, Grace,
in your fancy. I can see it in your eyes. I know it
<em>will</em> be happy, dear. How glad I am to know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried the Doctor, bustling in. &ldquo;Here we
are, all ready for Alfred, eh? He can&rsquo;t be here until
pretty late&mdash;an hour or so before midnight&mdash;so
there&rsquo;ll be plenty of time for making merry before he
comes. He&rsquo;ll not find us with the ice unbroken.
Pile up the fire here, Britain! Let it shine upon the
holly till it winks again. It&rsquo;s a world of nonsense,
Puss; true lovers and all the rest of it&mdash;all nonsense;
but we&rsquo;ll be nonsensical with the rest of &rsquo;em, and
give our true lover a mad welcome. Upon my word!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
said the old Doctor, looking at his daughters proudly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not clear to-night, among other absurdities, but
that I&rsquo;m the father of two handsome girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that one of them has ever done, or may do&mdash;may
do, dearest father&mdash;to cause you pain or grief,
forgive her,&rdquo; said Marion: &ldquo;forgive her now, when
her heart is full. Say that you forgive her. That
you will forgive her. That she shall always share
your love, and&mdash;,&rdquo; and the rest was not said,
for her face was hidden on the old man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, tut,&rdquo; said the Doctor, gently. &ldquo;Forgive!
What have I to forgive? Heyday, if our true lovers
come back to flurry us like this, we must hold &rsquo;em at
a distance; we must send expresses out to stop &rsquo;em
short upon the road, and bring &rsquo;em on a mile or two
a day, until we&rsquo;re properly prepared to meet &rsquo;em.
Kiss me, Puss. Forgive! Why, what a silly child
you are. If you had vexed and crossed me fifty times
a day, instead of not at all, I&rsquo;d forgive you everything,
but such a supplication. Kiss me again, Puss.
There! Prospective and retrospective&mdash;a clear score
between us. Pile up the fire here! Would you
freeze the people on this bleak December night!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Let us be light, and warm, and merry, or I&rsquo;ll not forgive
some of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So gaily the old Doctor carried it! And the fire
was piled up, and the lights were bright, and company
arrived, and a murmuring of lively tongues began, and
already there was a pleasant air of cheerful excitement
stirring through all the house.</p>

<p>More and more company came flocking in. Bright
eyes sparkled upon Marion; smiling lips gave her joy
of his return; sage mothers fanned themselves, and
hoped she mightn&rsquo;t be too youthful and inconstant for
the quiet round of home; impetuous fathers fell into
disgrace, for too much exaltation of her beauty;
daughters envied her; sons envied him; innumerable
pairs of lovers profited by the occasion; all were interested,
animated, and expectant.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Craggs came arm in arm, but Mrs.
Snitchey came alone. &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s become of <em>him</em>?&rdquo;
inquired the Doctor.</p>

<p>The feather of a Bird of Paradise in Mrs. Snitchey&rsquo;s
turban, trembled as if the bird of Paradise were alive
again, when she said that doubtless Mr. Craggs knew.
<em>She</em> was never told.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That nasty office,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it was burnt down,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s a little matter of business
that keeps my partner rather late,&rdquo; said Mr. Craggs,
looking uneasily about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h! Business. Don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We</em> know what business means,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Craggs.</p>

<p>But their not knowing what it meant, was perhaps
the reason why Mrs. Snitchey&rsquo;s Bird of Paradise
feather quivered so portentously, and all the pendant
bits on Mrs. Craggs&rsquo;s ear-rings shook like little bells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder <em>you</em> could come away, Mr. Craggs,&rdquo;
said his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craggs is fortunate, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That office so engrosses &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A person with an office has no business to be
married at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snitchey.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Snitchey said, within herself, that that
look of hers had pierced to Craggs&rsquo;s soul, and he
knew it: and Mrs. Craggs observed, to Craggs, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
&lsquo;his Snitcheys&rsquo; were deceiving him behind his back,
and he would find it out when it was too late.</p>

<p>Still, Mr. Craggs, without much heeding these remarks,
looked uneasily about him until his eye rested
on Grace, to whom he immediately presented himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Craggs. &ldquo;You look
charmingly. Your&mdash;Miss&mdash;your sister, Miss Marion,
is she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh she&rsquo;s quite well, Mr. Craggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;is she here?&rdquo; asked Craggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Don&rsquo;t you see her yonder? Going to
dance?&rdquo; said Grace.</p>

<p>Mr. Craggs put on his spectacles to see the better;
looked at her through them, for some time; coughed;
and put them, with an air of satisfaction, in their
sheath again, and in his pocket.</p>

<p>Now the music struck up, and the dance commenced.
The bright fire crackled and sparkled, rose
and fell, as though it joined the dance itself, in right
good fellowship. Sometimes it roared as if it would
make music too. Sometimes it flashed and beamed
as if it were the eye of the old room: it winked too,
sometimes, like a knowing patriarch, upon the youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
whisperers in corners. Sometimes it sported with
the holly-boughs; and, shining on the leaves by fits
and starts, made them look as if they were in the cold
winter night again, and fluttering in the wind. Sometimes
its genial humour grew obstreperous, and passed
all bounds; and then it cast into the room, among
the twinkling feet, with a loud burst, a shower of
harmless little sparks, and in its exultation leaped
and bounded, like a mad thing, up the broad old
chimney.</p>

<p>Another dance was near its close, when Mr.
Snitchey touched his partner, who was looking on,
upon the arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Craggs started, as if his familiar had been a
spectre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he gone?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! He has been with me,&rdquo; said Snitchey,
&ldquo;for three hours and more. He went over everything.
He looked into all our arrangements for him,
and was very particular indeed. He&mdash;Humph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dance was finished. Marion passed close
before him, as he spoke. She did not observe him,
or his partner; but looked over her shoulder towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
her sister in the distance, as she slowly made her way
into the crowd, and passed out of their view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see! All safe and well,&rdquo; said Mr. Craggs.
&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t recur to that subject, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is he really gone? Is he safe away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He keeps to his word. He drops down the river
with the tide in that shell of a boat of his, and so
goes out to sea on this dark night&mdash;a dare-devil he
is&mdash;before the wind. There&rsquo;s no such lonely road
anywhere else. That&rsquo;s one thing. The tide flows,
he says, an hour before midnight about this time.
I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; Mr. Snitchey wiped his forehead,
which looked hot and anxious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think,&rdquo; said Mr. Craggs, &ldquo;about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied his cautious partner, looking
straight before him. &ldquo;I understand you. Don&rsquo;t
mention names, and don&rsquo;t let us seem to be talking
secrets. I don&rsquo;t know what to think; and to tell you
the truth, I don&rsquo;t care now. It&rsquo;s a great relief.
His self-love deceived him, I suppose. Perhaps the
young lady coquetted a little. The evidence would
seem to point that way. Alfred not arrived?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Craggs. &ldquo;Expected every
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Mr. Snitchey wiped his forehead again.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great relief. I haven&rsquo;t been so nervous since
we&rsquo;ve been in partnership. I intend to spend the
evening now, Mr. Craggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Craggs and Mrs. Snitchey joined them as he
announced this intention. The Bird of Paradise was
in a state of extreme vibration; and the little bells
were ringing quite audibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been the theme of general comment, Mr.
Snitchey,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snitchey. &ldquo;I hope the office
is satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Satisfied with what, my dear?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the exposure of a defenceless woman to
ridicule and remark,&rdquo; returned his wife. &ldquo;That is
quite in the way of the office, <em>that</em> is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really, myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craggs, &ldquo;have
been so long accustomed to connect the office with
everything opposed to domesticity, that I am glad
to know it as the avowed enemy of my peace.
There is something honest in that, at all events.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; urged Mr. Craggs, &ldquo;your good
opinion is invaluable, but <em>I</em> never avowed that the
office was the enemy of your peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craggs, ringing a perfect peal
upon the little bells. &ldquo;Not you, indeed. You
wouldn&rsquo;t be worthy of the office, if you had the
candor to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to my having been away to-night, my dear,&rdquo;
said Mr. Snitchey, giving her his arm, &ldquo;the deprivation
has been mine, I&rsquo;m sure; but, as Mr. Craggs
knows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Snitchey cut this reference very short by
hitching her husband to a distance, and asking him
to look at that man. To do her the favor to look at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At which man, my dear?&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your chosen companion; <em>I</em>&rsquo;m no companion to
you Mr. Snitchey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, you are, my dear,&rdquo; he interposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No no, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snitchey with a
majestic smile. &ldquo;I know my station. Will you
look at your chosen companion, Mr. Snitchey; at
your referee; at the keeper of your secrets; at the
man you trust; at your other self, in short.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The habitual association of Self with Craggs,
occasioned Mr. Snitchey to look in that direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can look that man in the eye this night,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Snitchey, &ldquo;and not know that you are
deluded, practised upon: made the victim of his
arts, and bent down prostrate to his will, by some
unaccountable fascination which it is impossible to
explain, and against which no warning of mine is of
the least avail: all I can say is&mdash;I pity you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the very same moment Mrs. Craggs was
oracular on the cross subject. Was it possible she
said, that Craggs could so blind himself to his
Snitcheys, as not to feel his true position. Did he
mean to say that he had seen his Snitcheys come
into that room, and didn&rsquo;t plainly see that there was
reservation, cunning, treachery in the man? Would
he tell her that his very action, when he wiped his
forehead and looked so stealthily about him, didn&rsquo;t
show that there was something weighing on the
conscience of his precious Snitcheys (if he had a
conscience), that wouldn&rsquo;t bear the light. Did anybody
but his Snitcheys come to festive entertainments
like a burglar?&mdash;which, by the way, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hardly a clear illustration of the case, as he had
walked in very mildly at the door. And would he still
assert to her at noon-day (it being nearly midnight),
that his Snitcheys were to be justified through
thick and thin, against all facts, and reason, and
experience?</p>

<p>Neither Snitchey nor Craggs openly attempted to
stem the current which had thus set in, but both
were content to be carried gently along it, until its
force abated; which happened at about the same
time as a general movement for a country dance;
when Mr. Snitchey proposed himself as a partner
to Mrs. Craggs, and Mr. Craggs gallantly offered
himself to Mrs. Snitchey; and after some such slight
evasions as &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you ask somebody else?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be glad, I know, if I decline,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I
wonder you can dance out of the office&rdquo; (but this
jocosely now), each lady graciously accepted, and
took her place.</p>

<p>It was an old custom among them, indeed, to do
so, and to pair off, in like manner, at dinners and
suppers; for they were excellent friends, and on a
footing of easy familiarity. Perhaps the false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Craggs and the wicked Snitchey were a recognised
fiction with the two wives, as Doe and Roe, incessantly
running up and down bailiwicks, were with
the two husbands: or perhaps the ladies had instituted,
and taken upon themselves, these two shares
in the business, rather than be left out of it altogether.
But certain it is, that each wife went as
gravely and steadily to work in her vocation as her
husband did in his: and would have considered
it almost impossible for the Firm to maintain a
successful and respectable existence, without her
laudable exertions.</p>

<p>But now the Bird of Paradise was seen to flutter
down the middle; and the little bells began to
bounce and jingle in poussette; and the Doctor&rsquo;s
rosy face spun round and round, like an expressive
pegtop highly varnished; and breathless Mr. Craggs
began to doubt already, whether country dancing
had been made &ldquo;too easy,&rdquo; like the rest of life;
and Mr. Snitchey, with his nimble cuts and
capers, footed it for Self, and Craggs, and half a
dozen more.</p>

<p>Now, too, the fire took fresh courage, favored by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the lively wind the dance awakened, and burnt clear
and high. It was the Genius of the room, and
present everywhere. It shone in people&rsquo;s eyes, it
sparkled in the jewels on the snowy necks of girls,
it twinkled at their ears as if it whispered to them
slyly, it flashed about their waists, it flickered on the
ground and made it rosy for their feet, it bloomed upon
the ceiling that its glow might set off their bright
faces, and it kindled up a general illumination in
Mrs. Craggs&rsquo;s little belfry.</p>

<p>Now, too, the lively air that fanned it, grew less
gentle as the music quickened and the dance proceeded
with new spirit; and a breeze arose that made the
leaves and berries dance upon the wall, as they had
often done upon the trees; and rustled in the room as
if an invisible company of fairies, treading in the footsteps
of the good substantial revellers, were whirling
after them. Now, too, no feature of the Doctor&rsquo;s face
could be distinguished as he spun and spun; and now
there seemed a dozen Birds of Paradise in fitful flight;
and now there were a thousand little bells at work; and
now a fleet of flying skirts was ruffled by a little tempest;
when the music gave in, and the dance was over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Hot and breathless as the Doctor was, it only made
him the more
impatient
for Alfred&rsquo;s
coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything been seen, Britain? Anything been
heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too dark to see far, Sir. Too much noise inside
the house to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! The gayer welcome for him.
How goes the time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just twelve, Sir. He can&rsquo;t be long, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stir up the fire, and throw another log upon it,&rdquo;
said the Doctor. &ldquo;Let him see his welcome blazing
out upon the night&mdash;good boy!&mdash;as he comes
along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw it&mdash;Yes! From the chaise he caught
the light, as he turned the corner by the old church.
He knew the room from which it shone. He saw
the wintry branches of the old trees between the light
and him. He knew that one of those trees rustled
musically in the summer time at the window of
Marion&rsquo;s chamber.</p>

<p>The tears were in his eyes. His heart throbbed so
violently that he could hardly bear his happiness.
How often he had thought of this time&mdash;pictured it
under all circumstances&mdash;feared that it might never
come&mdash;yearned, and wearied for it&mdash;far away!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the light! Distinct and ruddy; kindled, he
knew, to give him welcome, and to speed him home.
He beckoned with his hand, and waved his hat, and
cheered out, loud, as if the light were they, and they
could see and hear him, as he dashed towards them
through the mud and mire, triumphantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; He knew the Doctor, and understood
what he had done. He would not let it be a surprise
to them. But he could make it one, yet, by going
forward on foot. If the orchard gate were open, he
could enter there; if not, the wall was easily climbed,
as he knew of old; and he would be among them in
an instant.</p>

<p>He dismounted from the chaise, and telling the
driver&mdash;even that was not easy in his agitation&mdash;to
remain behind for a few minutes, and then to follow
slowly, ran on with exceeding swiftness, tried the
gate, scaled the wall, jumped down on the other side,
and stood panting in the old orchard.</p>

<p>There was a frosty rime upon the trees, which, in
the faint light of the clouded moon, hung upon the
smaller branches like dead garlands. Withered
leaves crackled and snapped beneath his feet, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
he crept softly on towards the house. The desolation
of a winter night sat brooding on the earth,
and in the sky. But the red light came cheerily
towards him from the windows: figures passed and
repassed there: and the hum and murmur of voices
greeted his ear, sweetly.</p>

<p>Listening for hers: attempting, as he crept on, to
detach it from the rest, and half-believing that he
heard it: he had nearly reached the door, when it
was abruptly opened, and a figure coming out encountered
his. It instantly recoiled with a half-suppressed
cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clemency,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in,&rdquo; she answered, pushing him back.
&ldquo;Go away. Don&rsquo;t ask me why. Don&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&mdash;I am afraid to think. Go
back. Hark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sudden tumult in the house. She
put her hands upon her ears. A wild scream, such
as no hands could shut out, was heard; and Grace&mdash;distraction
in her looks and manner&mdash;rushed out at
the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Grace!&rdquo; He caught her in his arms. &ldquo;What
is it! Is she dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She disengaged herself, as if to recognise his face,
and fell down at his feet.</p>

<p>A crowd of figures came about them from the
house. Among them was her father, with a paper in
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it!&rdquo; cried Alfred, grasping his hair
with his hands, and looking in an agony from face
to face, as he bent upon his knee, beside the insensible
girl. &ldquo;Will no one look at me? Will no one speak
to me? Does no one know me? Is there no voice
among you all, to tell me what it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a murmur among them. &ldquo;She is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fled, my dear Alfred!&rdquo; said the Doctor, in a
broken voice, and with his hands before his face.
&ldquo;Gone from her home and us. To-night! She writes
that she has made her innocent and blameless choice&mdash;entreats
that we will forgive her&mdash;prays that we
will not forget her&mdash;and is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With whom? Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started up as if to follow in pursuit, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
they gave way to let him pass, looked wildly round
upon them, staggered back, and sunk down in his
former attitude, clasping one of Grace&rsquo;s cold hands
in his own.</p>

<p>There was a hurried running to and fro, confusion,
noise, disorder, and no purpose. Some proceeded to
disperse themselves about the roads, and some took
horse, and some got lights, and some conversed
together, urging that there was no trace or track to
follow. Some approached him kindly, with the view
of offering consolation; some admonished him that
Grace must be removed into the house, and he prevented
it. He never heard them, and he never moved.</p>

<p>The snow fell fast and thick. He looked up for
a moment in the air, and thought that those white
ashes strewn upon his hopes and misery, were suited
to them well. He looked round on the whitening
ground, and thought how Marion&rsquo;s foot-prints would
be hushed and covered up, as soon as made, and
even that remembrance of her blotted out. But he
never felt the weather, and he never stirred.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> world had grown six years older
since that night of the return. It was
a warm autumn afternoon, and there
had been heavy rain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun burst suddenly from among the clouds: and
the old battle-ground, sparkling brilliantly and cheerfully
at sight of it in one green place, flashed a
responsive welcome there, which spread along the
country side as if a joyful beacon had been lighted
up, and answered from a thousand stations.</p>

<p>How beautiful the landscape kindling in the light,
and that luxuriant influence passing on like a celestial
presence, brightening everything! The wood, a sombre
mass before, revealed its varied tints of yellow,
green, brown, red; its different forms of trees, with
raindrops glittering on their leaves and twinkling
as they fell. The verdant meadow-land, bright and
glowing, seemed as if it had been blind a minute
since, and now had found a sense of sight wherewith
to look up at the shining sky. Corn-fields, hedge-rows,
fences, homesteads, the clustered roofs, the steeple of
the church, the stream, the watermill, all sprung out
of the gloomy darkness, smiling. Birds sang sweetly,
flowers raised their drooping heads, fresh scents arose
from the invigorated ground; the blue expanse above,
extended and diffused itself; already the sun&rsquo;s slanting
rays pierced mortally the sullen bank of cloud that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
lingered in its flight; and a rainbow, spirit of all the
colors that adorned the earth and sky, spanned the
whole arch with its triumphant glory.</p>

<p>At such a time, one little roadside Inn, snugly sheltered
behind a great elm-tree with a rare seat for
idlers encircling its capacious bole, addressed a cheerful
front towards the traveller, as a house of entertainment
ought, and tempted him with many mute but
significant assurances of a comfortable welcome. The
ruddy sign-board perched up in the tree, with its
golden letters winking in the sun, ogled the passer-by
from among the green leaves, like a jolly face, and
promised good cheer. The horse-trough, full of clear
fresh water, and the ground below it, sprinkled with
droppings of fragrant hay, made every horse that passed
prick up his ears. The crimson curtains in the lower
rooms, and the pure white hangings in the little bed-chambers
above, beckoned, Come in! with every breath
of air. Upon the bright green shutters, there were
golden legends about beer and ale, and neat wines,
and good beds; and an affecting picture of a brown
jug frothing over at the top. Upon the window-sills
were flowering plants in bright red pots, which made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
lively show against the white front of the house; and in
the darkness of the doorway there were streaks of
light, which glanced off from the surfaces of bottles
and tankards.</p>

<p>On the door-step, appeared a proper figure of a
landlord, too; for though he was a short man, he was
round and broad; and stood with his hands in his
pockets, and his legs just wide enough apart to
express a mind at rest upon the subject of the cellar,
and an easy confidence&mdash;too calm and virtuous
to become a swagger&mdash;in the general resources of
the Inn. The superabundant moisture, trickling from
everything after the late rain, set him off well.
Nothing near him was thirsty. Certain top-heavy
dahlias, looking over the palings of his neat well-ordered
garden, had swilled as much as they could
carry&mdash;perhaps a trifle more&mdash;and may have been the
worse for liquor; but the sweetbriar, roses, wall-flowers,
the plants at the windows, and the leaves on the old
tree, were in the beaming state of moderate company
that had taken no more than was wholesome for
them, and had served to develope their best qualities.
Sprinkling dewy drops about them on the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they seemed profuse of innocent and sparkling mirth,
that did good where it lighted, softening neglected
corners which the steady rain could seldom reach,
and hurting nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>This village Inn had assumed, on being established,
an uncommon sign. It was called The Nutmeg
Grater. And underneath that household word, was
inscribed, up in the tree, on the same flaming board,
and in the like golden characters, By Benjamin Britain.</p>

<p>At a second glance, and on a more minute examination
of his face, you might have known that it was
no other than Benjamin Britain himself who stood in
the doorway&mdash;reasonably changed by time, but for
the better; a very comfortable host indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. B.,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain, looking down the
road, &ldquo;is rather late. It&rsquo;s tea time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As there was no Mrs. Britain coming, he strolled
leisurely out into the road and looked up at the
house, very much to his satisfaction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the
sort of house,&rdquo; said Benjamin, &ldquo;I should wish to stop
at, if I didn&rsquo;t keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he strolled towards the garden paling, and
took a look at the dahlias. They looked over at him,
with a helpless, drowsy hanging of their heads: which
bobbed again, as the heavy drops of wet dripped off
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be looked after,&rdquo; said Benjamin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
&ldquo;Memorandum, not to forget to tell her so. She&rsquo;s
a long time coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Britain&rsquo;s better half seemed to be by so very
much his better half, that his own moiety of himself
was utterly cast away and helpless without her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t much to do, I think,&rdquo; said Ben.
&ldquo;There were a few little matters of business after
market, but not many. Oh! here we are at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A chaise-cart, driven by a boy, came clattering
along the road: and seated in it, in a chair, with a
large well-saturated umbrella spread out to dry
behind her, was the plump figure of a matronly
woman, with her bare arms folded across a basket
which she carried on her knee, several other baskets
and parcels lying crowded about her, and a certain
bright good-nature in her face and contented
awkwardness in her manner, as she jogged to and
fro with the motion of her carriage, which smacked
of old times, even in the distance. Upon her nearer
approach, this relish of bygone days was not diminished;
and when the cart stopped at the Nutmeg
Grater door, a pair of shoes, alighting from it, slipped
nimbly through Mr. Britain&rsquo;s open arms, and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
down with a substantial weight upon the pathway,
which shoes could hardly have belonged to any one
but Clemency Newcome.</p>

<p>In fact they did belong to her, and she stood in
them, and a rosy comfortable-looking soul she was:
with as much soap on her glossy face as in times of
yore, but with whole elbows now, that had grown
quite dimpled in her improved condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re late, Clemmy!&rdquo; said Mr. Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, Ben, I&rsquo;ve had a deal to do!&rdquo; she
replied, looking busily after the safe removal into the
house of all the packages and baskets; &ldquo;eight, nine,
ten&mdash;where&rsquo;s eleven? Oh! my baskets, eleven!
It&rsquo;s all right. Put the horse up, Harry, and if
he coughs again give him a warm mash to-night.
Eight, nine, ten. Why, where&rsquo;s eleven? Oh I forgot,
it&rsquo;s all right. How&rsquo;s the children, Ben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hearty, Clemmy, hearty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless their precious faces!&rdquo; said Mrs. Britain,
unbonneting her own round countenance (for she and
her husband were by this time in the bar), and
smoothing her hair with her open hands. &ldquo;Give us
a kiss, old man.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Britain promptly complied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Britain, applying herself to
her pockets and drawing forth an immense bulk of
thin books and crumpled papers, a very kennel
of dogs&rsquo; ears: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done everything. Bills all
settled&mdash;turnips sold&mdash;brewer&rsquo;s account looked into
and paid&mdash;&rsquo;bacco pipes ordered&mdash;seventeen pound
four paid into the Bank&mdash;Doctor Heathfield&rsquo;s charge
for little Clem&mdash;you&rsquo;ll guess what that is&mdash;Doctor
Heathfield won&rsquo;t take nothing again, Ben.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. He says whatever family you was to have,
Ben, he&rsquo;d never put you to the cost of a halfpenny.
Not if you was to have twenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Britain&rsquo;s face assumed a serious expression,
and he looked hard at the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;nt it kind of him?&rdquo; said Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; returned Mr. Britain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sort of
kindness that I wouldn&rsquo;t presume upon, on any account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted Clemency. &ldquo;Of course not. Then
there&rsquo;s the pony&mdash;he fetched eight pound two; and
that a&rsquo;nt bad, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good,&rdquo; said Ben.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re pleased!&rdquo; exclaimed his wife.
&ldquo;I thought you would be; and I think that&rsquo;s all,
and so no more at present from yours and cetrer,
C. Britain. Ha ha ha! There! Take all the papers,
and lock &rsquo;em. Oh! Wait a minute. Here&rsquo;s a printed
bill to stick on the wall. Wet from the printer&rsquo;s.
How nice it smells!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said Ben, looking over the document.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied his wife. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read
a word of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To be sold by Auction,&rsquo;&rdquo; read the host of the
Nutmeg Grater, &ldquo;&lsquo;unless previously disposed of by
private contract.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They always put that,&rdquo; said Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they don&rsquo;t always put this,&rdquo; he returned.
&ldquo;Look here, &lsquo;Mansion&rsquo; &amp;c.&mdash;&lsquo;offices,&rsquo; &amp;c., &lsquo;shrubberies,&rsquo;
&amp;c., &lsquo;ring fence,&rsquo; &amp;c. &lsquo;Messrs. Snitchey and
Craggs,&rsquo; &amp;c. &lsquo;ornamental portion of the unencumbered
freehold property of Michael Warden, Esquire, intending
to continue to reside abroad&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Intending to continue to reside abroad!&rdquo; repeated
Clemency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was only this very day that I heard it
whispered at the old house, that better and plainer
news had been half promised of her, soon!&rdquo; said Clemency,
shaking her head sorrowfully, and patting her
elbows as if the recollection of old times unconsciously
awakened her old habits. &ldquo;Dear, dear, dear!
There&rsquo;ll be heavy hearts, Ben, yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Britain heaved a sigh, and shook his head, and
said he couldn&rsquo;t make it out: he had left off trying
long ago. With that remark, he applied himself to
putting up the bill just inside the bar window: and
Clemency, after meditating in silence for a few
moments, roused herself, cleared her thoughtful brow,
and bustled off to look after the children.</p>

<p>Though the host of the Nutmeg Grater had a
lively regard for his good-wife, it was of the old
patronising kind; and she amused him mightily.
Nothing would have astonished him so much, as to have
known for certain from any third party, that it was she
who managed the whole house, and made him, by her
plain straightforward thrift, good-humour, honesty, and
industry, a thriving man. So easy it is, in any degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of life, (as the world very often finds it,) to take those
cheerful natures that never assert their merit, at their
own modest valuation; and to conceive a flippant liking
of people for their outward oddities and eccentricities,
whose innate worth, if we would look so far, might
make us blush in the comparison!</p>

<p>It was comfortable to Mr. Britain, to think of his
own condescension in having married Clemency. She
was a perpetual testimony to him of the goodness of
his heart, and the kindness of his disposition; and he
felt that her being an excellent wife was an illustration
of the old precept that virtue is its own reward.</p>

<p>He had finished wafering up the bill, and had
locked the vouchers for her day&rsquo;s proceedings in the
cupboard&mdash;chuckling all the time, over her capacity
for business&mdash;when, returning with the news that the
two Master Britains were playing in the coach-house,
under the superintendence of one Betsey, and that
little Clem was sleeping &ldquo;like a picture,&rdquo; she sat
down to tea, which had awaited her arrival, on a
little table. It was a very neat little bar, with the
usual display of bottles and glasses; a sedate clock,
right to the minute (it was half-past five); everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in its place, and everything furbished and polished up
to the very utmost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve sat down quietly to-day, I
declare,&rdquo; said Mrs. Britain, taking a long breath, as
if she had sat down for the night; but getting up
again immediately to hand her husband his tea, and
cut him his bread-and-butter; &ldquo;how that bill does set
me thinking of old times!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Britain, handling his saucer like
an oyster, and disposing of its contents on the same
principle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That same Mr. Michael Warden,&rdquo; said Clemency,
shaking her head at the notice of sale, &ldquo;lost me
my old place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And got you your husband,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! So he did,&rdquo; retorted Clemency, &ldquo;and
many thanks to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s the creature of habit,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain,
surveying her, over his saucer. &ldquo;I had somehow
got used to you, Clem; and I found I shouldn&rsquo;t be
able to get on without you. So we went and got
made man and wife. Ha, ha! We! Who&rsquo;d have
thought it!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who indeed!&rdquo; cried Clemency. &ldquo;It was very
good of you, Ben.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; replied Mr. Britain, with an air of
self-denial. &ldquo;Nothing worth mentioning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes it was, Ben,&rdquo; said his wife, with great
simplicity; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I think so; and am very much
obliged to you. Ah!&rdquo; looking again at the bill;
&ldquo;when she was known to be gone, and out of reach,
dear girl, I couldn&rsquo;t help telling&mdash;for her sake quite
as much as theirs&mdash;what I knew, could I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told it, any how,&rdquo; observed her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Doctor Jeddler,&rdquo; pursued Clemency, putting
down her tea-cup, and looking thoughtfully at the bill,
&ldquo;in his grief and passion, turned me out of house and
home! I never have been so glad of anything in all
my life, as that I didn&rsquo;t say an angry word to him,
and hadn&rsquo;t an angry feeling towards him, even then;
for he repented that truly, afterwards. How often he
has sat in this room, and told me over and over again,
he was sorry for it!&mdash;the last time, only yesterday,
when you were out. How often he has sat in this
room, and talked to me, hour after hour, about one
thing and another, in which he made believe to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
interested!&mdash;but only for the sake of the days that
are gone away, and because he knows she used to
like me, Ben!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how did you ever come to catch a glimpse
of that, Clem?&rdquo; asked her husband: astonished that
she should have a distinct perception of a truth which
had only dimly suggested itself to his inquiring mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Clemency, blowing
her tea, to cool it. &ldquo;Bless you, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you if
you was to offer me a reward of a hundred pound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He might have pursued this metaphysical subject
but for her catching a glimpse of a substantial fact
behind him, in the shape of a gentleman attired in
mourning, and cloaked and booted like a rider on
horseback, who stood at the bar-door. He seemed
attentive to their conversation, and not at all impatient
to interrupt it.</p>

<p>Clemency hastily rose at this sight. Mr. Britain
also rose and saluted the guest. &ldquo;Will you please to
walk up stairs, Sir. There&rsquo;s a very nice room up
stairs, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the stranger, looking earnestly
at Mr. Britain&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;May I come in here?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely, if you like, Sir,&rdquo; returned Clemency,
admitting him. &ldquo;What would you please to want, Sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bill had caught his eye, and he was reading it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent property that, Sir,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Britain.</p>

<p>He made no answer; but turning round, when he
had finished reading, looked at Clemency with the
same observant curiosity as before. &ldquo;You were
asking me,&rdquo; he said, still looking at her&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you would please to take, Sir,&rdquo; answered
Clemency, stealing a glance at him in return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will let me have a draught of ale,&rdquo; he
said, moving to a table by the window, &ldquo;and will let
me have it here, without being any interruption to
your meal, I shall be much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down as he spoke, without any further
parley, and looked out at the prospect. He was an
easy well-knit figure of a man in the prime of life.
His face, much browned by the sun, was shaded by
a quantity of dark hair; and he wore a moustache.
His beer being set before him, he filled out a glass,
and drank, good-humouredly, to the house; adding,
as he put the tumbler down again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new house, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not particularly new, Sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between five and six years old,&rdquo; said Clemency:
speaking very distinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I heard you mention Doctor Jeddler&rsquo;s
name, as I came in,&rdquo; inquired the stranger. &ldquo;That
bill reminds me of him; for I happen to know something
of that story, by hearsay, and through certain
connexions of mine.&mdash;Is the old man living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s living, Sir,&rdquo; said Clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much changed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when, Sir?&rdquo; returned Clemency, with
remarkable emphasis and expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since his daughter&mdash;went away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! he&rsquo;s greatly changed since then,&rdquo; said
Clemency. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s grey and old, and hasn&rsquo;t the same
way with him at all; but I think he&rsquo;s happy now.
He has taken on with his sister since then, and
goes to see her very often. That did him good,
directly. At first, he was sadly broken down; and
it was enough to make one&rsquo;s heart bleed, to see
him wandering about, railing at the world; but a
great change for the better came over him after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
year or two, and then he began to like to talk about
his lost daughter, and to praise her, ay and the world
too! and was never tired of saying, with the tears in
his poor eyes, how beautiful and good she was. He
had forgiven her then. That was about the same time
as Miss Grace&rsquo;s marriage. Britain, you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Britain remembered very well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sister <em>is</em> married then,&rdquo; returned the
stranger. He paused for some time before he asked,
&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency narrowly escaped oversetting the tea-board,
in her emotion at this question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did <em>you</em> never hear?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to hear,&rdquo; he replied, as he filled his
glass again, and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! It would be a long story, if it was properly
told,&rdquo; said Clemency, resting her chin on the palm
of her left hand, and supporting that elbow on her
right hand, as she shook her head, and looked back
through the intervening years, as if she were looking
at a fire. &ldquo;It would be a long story, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But told as a short one,&rdquo; suggested the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Told as a short one,&rdquo; repeated Clemency in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
same thoughtful tone, and without any apparent
reference to him, or consciousness of having auditors,
&ldquo;what would there be to tell? That they grieved
together, and remembered her together, like a person
dead; that they were so tender of her, never would
reproach her, called her back to one another as she
used to be, and found excuses for her? Every one
knows that. I&rsquo;m sure <em>I</em> do. No one better,&rdquo; added
Clemency, wiping her eyes with her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; suggested the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Clemency, taking him up mechanically,
and without any change in her attitude or
manner, &ldquo;they at last were married. They were
married on her birth-day&mdash;it comes round again to-morrow&mdash;very
quiet, very humble like, but very happy.
Mr. Alfred said, one night when they were walking
in the orchard, &lsquo;Grace, shall our wedding-day be
Marion&rsquo;s birth-day?&rsquo; And it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they have lived happily together?&rdquo; said the
stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Clemency. &ldquo;No two people ever
more so. They have had no sorrow but this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her head as with a sudden attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to the circumstances under which she was recalling
these events, and looked quickly at the stranger.
Seeing that his face was turned towards the window,
and that he seemed intent upon the prospect, she
made some eager signs to her husband, and pointed
to the bill, and moved her mouth as if she were
repeating with great energy, one word or phrase to
him over and over again. As she uttered no sound,
and as her dumb motions like most of her gestures
were of a very extraordinary kind, this unintelligible
conduct reduced Mr. Britain to the confines of
despair. He stared at the table, at the stranger,
at the spoons, at his wife&mdash;followed her pantomime
with looks of deep amazement and perplexity&mdash;asked
in the same language, was it property in danger, was
it he in danger, was it she&mdash;answered her signals
with other signals expressive of the deepest distress
and confusion&mdash;followed the motions of her lips&mdash;guessed
half aloud &ldquo;milk and water,&rdquo; &ldquo;monthly
warning,&rdquo; &ldquo;mice and walnuts&rdquo;&mdash;and couldn&rsquo;t
approach her meaning.</p>

<p>Clemency gave it up at last, as a hopeless attempt;
and moving her chair by very slow degrees a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
nearer to the stranger, sat with her eyes apparently
cast down but glancing sharply at him now and
then, waiting until he should ask some other
question. She had not to wait long; for he said,
presently,</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the after history of the young lady
who went away? They know it, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;that Doctor Jeddler is thought to know more
of it than he tells. Miss Grace has had letters from
her sister, saying that she was well and happy, and
made much happier by her being married to Mr.
Alfred: and has written letters back. But there&rsquo;s a
mystery about her life and fortunes, altogether, which
nothing has cleared up to this hour, and which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She faltered here, and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And which&mdash;&rdquo; repeated the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which only one other person, I believe, could
explain,&rdquo; said Clemency, drawing her breath quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who may that be?&rdquo; asked the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Michael Warden!&rdquo; answered Clemency,
almost in a shriek: at once conveying to her husband
what she would have had him understand before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and letting Michael Warden know that he was
recognised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember me, Sir,&rdquo; said Clemency, trembling
with emotion; &ldquo;I saw just now you did! You
remember me, that night in the garden. I was with
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You were,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; returned Clemency. &ldquo;Yes, to be
sure. This is my husband, if you please. Ben, my
dear Ben, run to Miss Grace&mdash;run to Mr. Alfred&mdash;run
somewhere, Ben! Bring somebody here, directly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; said Michael Warden, quietly interposing
himself between the door and Britain. &ldquo;What would
you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them know that you are here, Sir,&rdquo; answered
Clemency, clapping her hands in sheer agitation.
&ldquo;Let them know that they may hear of her, from your
own lips; let them know that she is not quite lost to
them, but that she will come home again yet, to bless
her father and her loving sister&mdash;even her old servant,
even me,&rdquo; she struck herself upon the breast with
both hands, &ldquo;with a sight of her sweet face. Run,
Ben, run!&rdquo; And still she pressed him on towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the door, and still Mr. Warden stood before it, with
his hand stretched out, not angrily, but sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps,&rdquo; said Clemency, running past her
husband, and catching in her emotion at Mr. Warden&rsquo;s
cloak, &ldquo;perhaps she&rsquo;s here now; perhaps she&rsquo;s close
by. I think from your manner she is. Let me
see her, Sir, if you please. I waited on her when
she was a little child. I saw her grow to be the
pride of all this place. I knew her when she was Mr.
Alfred&rsquo;s promised wife. I tried to warn her when
you tempted her away. I know what her old home
was when she was like the soul of it, and how it
changed when she was gone and lost. Let me speak
to her, if you please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gazed at her with compassion, not unmixed with
wonder: but he made no gesture of assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she <em>can</em> know,&rdquo; pursued Clemency,
&ldquo;how truly they forgive her; how they love her;
what joy it would be to them, to see her once more.
She may be timorous of going home. Perhaps if she
sees me, it may give her new heart. Only tell me
truly, Mr. Warden, is she with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not,&rdquo; he answered, shaking his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>This answer, and his manner, and his black dress,
and his coming back so quietly, and his announced
intention of continuing to live abroad, explained it all.
Marion was dead.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t contradict her; yes, she was dead!
Clemency sat down, hid her face upon the table, and
cried.</p>

<p>At that moment, a grey-headed old gentleman
came running in quite out of breath, and panting so
much that his voice was scarcely to be recognised as
the voice of Mr. Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heaven, Mr. Warden!&rdquo; said the lawyer,
taking him aside, &ldquo;what wind has blown&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
was so blown himself, that he couldn&rsquo;t get on any
further until after a pause, when he added, feebly,
&ldquo;you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ill wind, I am afraid,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If
you could have heard what has just passed&mdash;how I
have been besought and entreated to perform impossibilities&mdash;what
confusion and affliction I carry with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can guess it all. But why did you ever come
here, my good Sir?&rdquo; retorted Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come! How should I know who kept the house?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
When I sent my servant on to you, I strolled in here
because the place was new to me; and I had a natural
curiosity in everything new and old, in these old
scenes; and it was outside the town. I wanted to
communicate with you first, before appearing there. I
wanted to know what people would say to me. I see
by your manner that you can tell me. If it were not
for your confounded caution, I should have been possessed
of everything long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our caution!&rdquo; returned the lawyer. &ldquo;Speaking
for Self and Craggs&mdash;deceased,&rdquo; here Mr. Snitchey,
glancing at his hat-band, shook his head, &ldquo;how can
you reasonably blame us, Mr. Warden? It was understood
between us that the subject was never to be
renewed, and that it wasn&rsquo;t a subject on which grave and
sober men like us (I made a note of your observations
at the time) could interfere? Our caution too! when
Mr. Craggs, Sir, went down to his respected grave
in the full belief&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had given a solemn promise of silence until I
should return, whenever that might be,&rdquo; interrupted
Mr. Warden; &ldquo;and I have kept it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir, and I repeat it,&rdquo; returned Mr. Snitchey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
&ldquo;we were bound to silence too. We were bound to
silence in our duty towards ourselves, and in our duty
towards a variety of clients, you among them, who
were as close as wax. It was not our place to make
inquiries of you on such a delicate subject. I had
my suspicions, Sir; but it is not six months since I
have known the truth, and been assured that you
lost her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; inquired his client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Doctor Jeddler himself, Sir, who at last
reposed that confidence in me voluntarily. He, and
only he, has known the whole truth, years and years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know it?&rdquo; said his client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, Sir!&rdquo; replied Snitchey; &ldquo;and I have also
reason to know that it will be broken to her sister
to-morrow evening. They have given her that promise.
In the meantime, perhaps you&rsquo;ll give me
the honor of your company at my house; being
unexpected at your own. But, not to run the chance
of any more such difficulties as you have had here,
in case you should be recognised&mdash;though you&rsquo;re
a good deal changed&mdash;I think I might have passed
you myself, Mr. Warden&mdash;we had better dine here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
walk on in the evening. It&rsquo;s a very good place to
dine at, Mr. Warden: your own property, by the bye.
Self and Craggs (deceased) took a chop here sometimes,
and had it very comfortably served. Mr. Craggs,
Sir,&rdquo; said Snitchey, shutting his eyes tight for an
instant, and opening them again, &ldquo;was struck off the
roll of life too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven forgive me for not condoling with you,&rdquo;
returned Michael Warden, passing his hand across his
forehead, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m like a man in a dream at present.
I seem to want my wits. Mr. Craggs&mdash;yes&mdash;I am
very sorry we have lost Mr. Craggs.&rdquo; But he looked
at Clemency as he said it, and seemed to sympathise
with Ben, consoling her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craggs, Sir,&rdquo; observed Snitchey, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
find life, I regret to say, as easy to have and to hold as
his theory made it out, or he would have been among
us now. It&rsquo;s a great loss to me. He was my right
arm, my right leg, my right ear, my right eye, was
Mr. Craggs. I am paralytic without him. He
bequeathed his share of the business to Mrs. Craggs,
her executors, administrators, and assigns. His name
remains in the Firm to this hour. I try, in a childish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
sort of a way, to make believe, sometimes, that he&rsquo;s
alive. You may observe that I speak for Self and Craggs&mdash;deceased
Sir&mdash;deceased,&rdquo; said the tender-hearted
attorney, waving his pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>Michael Warden, who had still been observant of
Clemency, turned to Mr. Snitchey, when he ceased to
speak, and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor thing!&rdquo; said Snitchey, shaking his
head. &ldquo;Yes. She was always very faithful to
Marion. She was always very fond of her. Pretty
Marion! Poor Marion! Cheer up, Mistress&mdash;you <em>are</em>
married now, you know, Clemency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clemency only sighed, and shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well! Wait &rsquo;till to-morrow,&rdquo; said the
lawyer, kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow can&rsquo;t bring back the dead to life,
Mister,&rdquo; said Clemency, sobbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It can&rsquo;t do that, or it would bring back Mr.
Craggs, deceased,&rdquo; returned the lawyer. &ldquo;But it
may bring some soothing circumstances; it may bring
some comfort. Wait &rsquo;till to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Clemency, shaking his proffered hand, said that
she would; and Britain, who had been terribly cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
down at sight of his despondent wife (which was like the
business hanging its head), said that was right; and
Mr. Snitchey and Michael Warden went up stairs;
and there they were soon engaged in a conversation so
cautiously conducted, that no murmur of it was audible
above the clatter of plates and dishes, the hissing of
the frying-pan, the bubbling of saucepans, the low
monotonous waltzing of the Jack&mdash;with a dreadful
click every now and then as if it had met with some
mortal accident to its head, in a fit of giddiness&mdash;and
all the other preparations in the kitchen, for their
dinner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To-morrow was a bright and peaceful day; and
nowhere were the autumn tints more beautifully seen,
than from the quiet orchard of the Doctor&rsquo;s house.
The snows of many winter nights had melted from that
ground, the withered leaves of many summer times had
rustled there, since she had fled. The honey-suckle
porch was green again, the trees cast bountiful and
changing shadows on the grass, the landscape was as
tranquil and serene as it had ever been; but where
was she!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Not there. Not there. She would have been a
stranger sight in her old home now, even than that home
had been at first, without her. But a lady sat in the
familiar place, from whose heart she had never passed
away; in whose true memory she lived, unchanging,
youthful, radiant with all promise and all hope; in
whose affection&mdash;and it was a mother&rsquo;s now: there
was a cherished little daughter playing by her
side&mdash;she had no rival, no successor; upon whose
gentle lips her name was trembling then.</p>

<p>The spirit of the lost girl looked out of those eyes.
Those eyes of Grace, her sister, sitting with her husband
in the orchard, on their wedding-day, and his and
Marion&rsquo;s birth-day.</p>

<p>He had not become a great man; he had not
grown rich; he had not forgotten the scenes and
friends of his youth: he had not fulfilled any one of
the Doctor&rsquo;s old predictions. But in his useful,
patient, unknown visiting of poor men&rsquo;s homes; and
in his watching of sick beds; and in his daily knowledge
of the gentleness and goodness flowering the
bye-paths of the world, not to be trodden down
beneath the heavy foot of poverty, but springing up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
elastic, in its track, and making its way beautiful;
he had better learned and proved, in each succeeding
year, the truth of his old faith. The manner of his
life, though quiet and remote, had shown him how
often men still entertained angels, unawares, as in the
olden time; and how the most unlikely forms&mdash;even
some that were mean and ugly to the view, and poorly
clad&mdash;became irradiated by the couch of sorrow,
want, and pain, and changed to ministering spirits
with a glory round their heads.</p>

<p>He lived to better purpose on the altered battle-ground
perhaps, than if he had contended restlessly
in more ambitious lists; and he was happy with his
wife, dear Grace.</p>

<p>And Marion. Had <em>he</em> forgotten her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The time has flown, dear Grace,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;since then;&rdquo; they had been talking of that night;
&ldquo;and yet it seems a long long while ago. We count
by changes and events within us. Not by years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet we have years to count by, too, since Marion
was with us,&rdquo; returned Grace. &ldquo;Six times, dear
husband, counting to-night as one, we have sat here
on her birth-day, and spoken together of that happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
return, so eagerly expected and so long deferred.
Ah when will it be! When will it be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her husband attentively observed her, as the tears
collected in her eyes; and drawing nearer, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Marion told you, in that farewell letter
which she left for you upon your table, love, and
which you read so often, that years must pass away
before it <em>could</em> be. Did she not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took a letter from her breast, and kissed it,
and said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That through those intervening years, however
happy she might be, she would look forward to the
time when you would meet again, and all would be
made clear: and prayed you, trustfully and hopefully
to do the same. The letter runs so, does it not, my
dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Alfred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And every other letter she has written since?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except the last&mdash;some months ago&mdash;in which
she spoke of you, and what you then knew, and
what I was to learn to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked towards the sun, then fast declining,
and said that the appointed time was sunset.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Alfred!&rdquo; said Grace, laying her hand upon
his shoulder earnestly, &ldquo;there is something in this
letter&mdash;this old letter, which you say I read so often&mdash;that
I have never told you. But to-night, dear
husband, with that sunset drawing near, and all our
life seeming to soften and become hushed with the
departing day, I cannot keep it secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Marion went away, she wrote me, here,
that you had once left her a sacred trust to me, and
that now she left you, Alfred, such a trust in my
hands: praying and beseeching me, as I loved her,
and as I loved you, not to reject the affection she
believed (she knew, she said) you would transfer to
me when the new wound was healed, but to encourage
and return it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And make me a proud, and happy man again,
Grace. Did she say so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She meant, to make myself so blest and honored
in your love,&rdquo; was his wife&rsquo;s answer, as he held her
in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear me, my dear!&rdquo; he said.&mdash;&ldquo;No. Hear
me so!&rdquo;&mdash;and as he spoke, he gently laid the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
she had raised, again upon his shoulder. &ldquo;I know
why I have never heard this passage in the letter,
until now. I know why no trace of it ever shewed
itself in any word or look of yours at that time. I
know why Grace, although so true a friend to me,
was hard to win to be my wife. And knowing it,
my own! I know the priceless value of the heart
I gird within my arms, and thank GOD for the rich
possession!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wept, but not for sorrow, as he pressed her to
his heart. After a brief space, he looked down at
the child, who was sitting at their feet, playing with
a little basket of flowers, and bade her look how
golden and how red the sun was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo; said Grace, raising her head quickly
at these words. &ldquo;The sun is going down. You have
not forgotten what I am to know before it sets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to know the truth of Marion&rsquo;s history,
my love,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the truth,&rdquo; she said, imploringly. &ldquo;Nothing
veiled from me, any more. That was the promise.
Was it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; he answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Before the sun went down on Marion&rsquo;s birth-day.
And you see it, Alfred? It is sinking fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his arm about her waist; and, looking
steadily into her eyes, rejoined,</p>

<p>&ldquo;That truth is not reserved so long for me to tell,
dear Grace. It is to come from other lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From other lips!&rdquo; she faintly echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know your constant heart, I know how
brave you are, I know that to you a word of preparation
is enough. You have said, truly, that the time
is come. It is. Tell me that you have present
fortitude to bear a trial&mdash;a surprise&mdash;a shock: and
the messenger is waiting at the gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What messenger?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And what intelligence
does he bring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am pledged,&rdquo; he answered her, preserving his
steady look, &ldquo;to say no more. Do you think you
understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid to think,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>There was that emotion in his face, despite its
steady gaze, which frightened her. Again she hid
her own face on his shoulder, trembling, and entreated
him to pause&mdash;a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Courage, my wife! When you have firmness
to receive the messenger, the messenger is waiting
at the gate. The sun is setting on Marion&rsquo;s birth-day.
Courage, courage, Grace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her head, and, looking at him, told
him she was ready. As she stood, and looked upon
him going away, her face was so like Marion&rsquo;s as
it had been in her later days at home, that it was
wonderful to see. He took the child with him.
She called her back&mdash;she bore the lost girl&rsquo;s name&mdash;and
pressed her to her bosom. The little creature,
being released again, sped after him, and Grace was
left alone.</p>

<p>She knew not what she dreaded, or what hoped;
but remained there, motionless, looking at the porch
by which they had disappeared.</p>

<p>Ah! what was that, emerging from its shadow;
standing on its threshold! that figure, with its white
garments rustling in the evening air; its head laid
down upon her father&rsquo;s breast, and pressed against it
to his loving heart! Oh, God! was it a vision that
came bursting from the old man&rsquo;s arms, and with a
cry, and with a waving of its hands, and with a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
precipitation of itself upon her in its boundless love,
sank down in her embrace!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Marion, Marion! Oh, my sister! Oh, my
heart&rsquo;s dear love! Oh, joy and happiness unutterable,
so to meet again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was no dream, no phantom conjured up by hope
and fear, but Marion, sweet Marion! So beautiful,
so happy, so unalloyed by care and trial, so elevated
and exalted in her loveliness, that as the setting sun
shone brightly on her upturned face, she might have
been a spirit visiting the earth upon some healing
mission.</p>

<p>Clinging to her sister, who had dropped upon a
seat, and bent down over her: and smiling through
her tears, and kneeling close before her, with both
arms twining round her, and never turning for an
instant from her face: and with the glory of the
setting sun upon her brow, and with the soft tranquillity
of evening gathering around them: Marion at
length broke silence; her voice, so calm, low, clear,
and pleasant, well-tuned to the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When this was my dear home, Grace, as it will
be now, again&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, my sweet love! A moment! Oh Marion,
to hear you speak again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not bear the voice she loved so well, at
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When this was my dear home, Grace, as it will
be now, again, I loved him from my soul. I loved
him most devotedly. I would have died for him,
though I was so young. I never slighted his affection
in my secret breast, for one brief instant. It was far
beyond all price to me. Although it is so long ago,
and past and gone, and everything is wholly changed,
I could not bear to think that you, who love so well,
should think I did not truly love him once. I never
loved him better, Grace, than when he left this very
scene upon this very day. I never loved him better,
dear one, than I did that night when <em>I</em> left here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her sister, bending over her, could only look into
her face, and hold her fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he had gained, unconsciously,&rdquo; said Marion,
with a gentle smile, &ldquo;another heart, before I knew
that I had one to give him. That heart&mdash;yours, my
sister&mdash;was so yielded up, in all its other tenderness,
to me; was so devoted, and so noble; that it plucked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
its love away, and kept its secret from all eyes but
mine&mdash;Ah! what other eyes were quickened by such
tenderness and gratitude!&mdash;and was content to
sacrifice itself to me. But I knew something of its
depths. I knew the struggle it had made. I knew
its high, inestimable worth to him, and his appreciation
of it, let him love me as he would. I
knew the debt I owed it. I had its great example
every day before me. What you had done for me, I
knew that I could do, Grace, if I would, for you. I
never laid my head down on my pillow, but I prayed
with tears to do it. I never laid my head down on
my pillow, but I thought of Alfred&rsquo;s own words, on
the day of his departure, and how truly he had said
(for I knew that, by you) that there were victories
gained every day, in struggling hearts, to which these
fields of battle were as nothing. Thinking more and
more upon the great endurance cheerfully sustained,
and never known or cared for, that there must be
every day and hour, in that great strife of which he
spoke, my trial seemed to grow light and easy: and
He who knows our hearts, my dearest, at this moment,
and who knows there is no drop of bitterness or grief&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
anything but unmixed happiness&mdash;in mine,
enabled me to make the resolution that I never
would be Alfred&rsquo;s wife. That he should be my
brother, and your husband, if the course I took could
bring that happy end to pass; but that I never would
(Grace, I then loved him dearly, dearly!) be his
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Marion! oh, Marion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had tried to seem indifferent to him;&rdquo; and she
pressed her sister&rsquo;s face against her own; &ldquo;but
that was hard, and you were always his true advocate.
I had tried to tell you of my resolution, but you
would never hear me; you would never understand
me. The time was drawing near for his return. I
felt that I must act, before the daily intercourse
between us was renewed. I knew that one great
pang, undergone at that time, would save a lengthened
agony to all of us. I knew that if I
went away then, that end must follow which <em>has</em>
followed, and which has made us both so happy,
Grace! I wrote to good Aunt Martha, for a refuge
in her house: I did not then tell her all, but something
of my story, and she freely promised it. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
I was contesting that step with myself, and with my
love of you, and home, Mr. Warden, brought here by
an accident, became, for some time, our companion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sometimes feared of late years, that this
might have been,&rdquo; exclaimed her sister, and her
countenance was ashy-pale. &ldquo;You never loved him&mdash;and
you married him in your self-sacrifice to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was then,&rdquo; said Marion, drawing her sister
closer to her, &ldquo;on the eve of going secretly away
for a long time. He wrote to me, after leaving here;
told me what his condition and prospects really were;
and offered me his hand. He told me he had seen I
was not happy in the prospect of Alfred&rsquo;s return.
I believe he thought my heart had no part in that
contract; perhaps thought I might have loved him
once, and did not then; perhaps thought that when
I tried to seem indifferent, I tried to hide indifference&mdash;I
cannot tell. But I wished that you should feel
me wholly lost to Alfred&mdash;hopeless to him&mdash;dead.
Do you understand me, love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her sister looked into her face, attentively. She
seemed in doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Mr. Warden, and confided in his honor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
charged him with my secret, on the eve of his and
my departure. He kept it. Do you understand me,
dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace looked confusedly upon her. She scarcely
seemed to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My love, my sister!&rdquo; said Marion, &ldquo;recall your
thoughts a moment: listen to me. Do not look so
strangely on me. There are countries, dearest, where
those who would abjure a misplaced passion, or would
strive against some cherished feeling of their hearts
and conquer it, retire into a hopeless solitude, and
close the world against themselves and worldly loves
and hopes for ever. When women do so, they assume
that name which is so dear to you and me, and call
each other Sisters. But there may be sisters, Grace,
who, in the broad world out of doors, and underneath
its free sky, and in its crowded places and
among its busy life, and trying to assist and cheer it
and to do some good,&mdash;learn the same lesson; and,
with hearts still fresh and young, and open to all
happiness and means of happiness, can say the
battle is long past, the victory long won. And
such a one am I! You understand me now?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Still she looked fixedly upon her, and made no
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Grace, dear Grace,&rdquo; said Marion, clinging yet
more tenderly and fondly to that breast from which
she had been so long exiled, &ldquo;if you were not a
happy wife and mother&mdash;if I had no little namesake
here&mdash;if Alfred, my kind brother, were not your
own fond husband&mdash;from whence could I derive the
ecstasy I feel to-night! But as I left here, so I have
returned. My heart has known no other love, my
hand has never been bestowed apart from it, I am
still your maiden sister: unmarried, unbetrothed: your
own old loving Marion, in whose affection you exist
alone, and have no partner, Grace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She understood her now. Her face relaxed; sobs
came to her relief; and falling on her neck, she wept
and wept, and fondled her as if she were a child again.</p>

<p>When they were more composed, they found that
the Doctor, and his sister good Aunt Martha, were
standing near at hand, with Alfred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a weary day for me,&rdquo; said good Aunt
Martha, smiling through her tears, as she embraced
her nieces; &ldquo;for I lose my dear companion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
making you all happy; and what can you give me in
return for my Marion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A converted brother,&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something, to be sure,&rdquo; retorted Aunt
Martha, &ldquo;in such a farce as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, pray don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Doctor, penitently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Aunt Martha. &ldquo;But I
consider myself ill-used. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s to
become of me without my Marion, after we have lived
together half-a-dozen years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must come and live here, I suppose,&rdquo; replied
the Doctor. &ldquo;We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t quarrel now, Martha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or get married, Aunt,&rdquo; said Alfred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; returned the old lady, &ldquo;I think it
might be a good speculation if I were to set my cap
at Michael Warden, who, I hear, is come home much
the better for his absence, in all respects. But as I
knew him when he was a boy, and I was not a very
young woman then, perhaps he mightn&rsquo;t respond.
So I&rsquo;ll make up my mind to go and live with Marion,
when she marries, and until then (it will not be very
long, I dare say) to live alone. What do <em>you</em> say,
Brother?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to say it&rsquo;s a ridiculous world
altogether, and there&rsquo;s nothing serious in it,&rdquo; observed
the poor old Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might take twenty affidavits of it if you
chose, Anthony,&rdquo; said his sister; &ldquo;but nobody would
believe you with such eyes as those.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a world full of hearts,&rdquo; said the Doctor; hugging
his younger daughter, and bending across her to
hug Grace&mdash;for he couldn&rsquo;t separate the sisters; &ldquo;and
a serious world, with all its folly&mdash;even with mine,
which was enough to have swamped the whole globe;
and a world on which the sun never rises, but it looks
upon a thousand bloodless battles that are some set-off
against the miseries and wickedness of Battle-Fields;
and a world we need be careful how we libel,
Heaven forgive us, for it is a world of sacred mysteries,
and its Creator only knows what lies beneath
the surface of His lightest image!&rdquo;</p>

<p>You would not be the better pleased with my rude
pen, if it dissected and laid open to your view the transports
of this family, long severed and now reunited.
Therefore, I will not follow the poor Doctor through
his humbled recollection of the sorrow he had had, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Marion was lost to him; nor will I tell how serious he
had found that world to be, in which some love
deep-anchored, is the portion of all human creatures;
nor how such a trifle as the absence of one little unit
in the great absurd account, had stricken him to the
ground. Nor how, in compassion for his distress, his
sister had, long ago, revealed the truth to him, by slow
degrees; and brought him to the knowledge of the
heart of his self-banished daughter, and to that
daughter&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>Nor how Alfred Heathfield had been told the truth,
too, in the course of that then current year; and
Marion had seen him, and had promised him, as her
brother, that on her birth-day, in the evening, Grace
should know it from her lips at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Doctor,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey,
looking into the orchard, &ldquo;but have I liberty to come
in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting for permission, he came straight
to Marion, and kissed her hand, quite joyfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Craggs had been alive, my dear Miss
Marion,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey, &ldquo;he would have had
great interest in this occasion. It might have suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to him, Mr. Alfred, that our life is not too easy,
perhaps; that, taken altogether, it will bear any little
smoothing we can give it; but Mr. Craggs was a man
who could endure to be convinced, Sir. He was
always open to conviction. If he were open to conviction
now, I&mdash;this is weakness. Mrs. Snitchey, my
dear,&rdquo;&mdash;at his summons that lady appeared from
behind the door, &ldquo;you are among old friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Snitchey having delivered her congratulations,
took her husband aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment, Mr. Snitchey,&rdquo; said that lady.
&ldquo;It is not in my nature to rake up the ashes of the
departed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No my dear,&rdquo; returned her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craggs is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, he is deceased,&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I ask you if you recollect,&rdquo; pursued his wife,
&ldquo;that evening of the ball. I only ask you that. If
you do; and if your memory has not entirely failed
you, Mr. Snitchey; and if you are not absolutely in
your dotage; I ask you to connect this time with that&mdash;to
remember how I begged and prayed you, on
my knees&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon your knees, my dear?&rdquo; said Mr. Snitchey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snitchey, confidently, &ldquo;and you
know it&mdash;to beware of that man&mdash;to observe his eye&mdash;and
now to tell me whether I was right, and
whether at that moment he knew secrets which he
didn&rsquo;t choose to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Snitchey,&rdquo; returned her husband, in her
ear, &ldquo;Madam. Did you ever observe anything in
<em>my</em> eye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snitchey, sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
flatter yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, Ma&rsquo;am, that night,&rdquo; he continued, twitching
her by the sleeve, &ldquo;it happens that we both
knew secrets which we didn&rsquo;t choose to tell, and both
knew just the same, professionally. And so the less
you say about such things the better, Mrs. Snitchey;
and take this as a warning to have wiser and more
charitable eyes another time. Miss Marion, I brought
a friend of yours along with me. Here! Mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Clemency, with her apron to her eyes, came
slowly in, escorted by her husband; the latter doleful
with the presentiment, that if she abandoned herself
to grief, the Nutmeg Grater was done for.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mistress,&rdquo; said the lawyer, checking Marion
as she ran towards her, and interposing himself between
them, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with <em>you</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The matter!&rdquo; cried poor Clemency.</p>

<p>When, looking up in wonder, and in indignant
remonstrance, and in the added emotion of a great
roar from Mr. Britain, and seeing that sweet face so
well-remembered close before her, she stared, sobbed,
laughed, cried, screamed, embraced her, held her
fast, released her, fell on Mr. Snitchey and embraced
him (much to Mrs. Snitchey&rsquo;s indignation), fell on
the Doctor and embraced him, fell on Mr. Britain
and embraced him, and concluded by embracing herself,
throwing her apron over her head, and going
into hysterics behind it.</p>

<p>A stranger had come into the orchard, after Mr.
Snitchey, and had remained apart, near the gate,
without being observed by any of the group; for they
had little spare attention to bestow, and that had
been monopolised by the ecstasies of Clemency. He
did not appear to wish to be observed, but stood
alone, with downcast eyes; and there was an air of
dejection about him (though he was a gentleman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a gallant appearance) which the general happiness
rendered more remarkable.</p>

<p>None but the quick eyes of Aunt Martha, however,
remarked him at all; but almost as soon as she
espied him, she was in conversation with him. Presently,
going to where Marion stood with Grace and
her little namesake, she whispered something in
Marion&rsquo;s ear, at which she started, and appeared
surprised; but soon recovering from her confusion, she
timidly approached the stranger, in Aunt Martha&rsquo;s
company, and engaged in conversation with him too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Britain,&rdquo; said the lawyer, putting his hand
in his pocket, and bringing out a legal-looking document,
while this was going on, &ldquo;I congratulate you.
You are now the whole and sole proprietor of that
freehold tenement, at present occupied and held by
yourself as a licensed tavern, or house of public
entertainment, and commonly called or known by
the sign of the Nutmeg Grater. Your wife lost
one house, through my client Mr. Michael Warden;
and now gains another. I shall have the pleasure
of canvassing you for the county, one of these fine
mornings.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it make any difference in the vote if the
sign was altered, Sir?&rdquo; asked Britain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; replied the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mr. Britain, handing him back the
conveyance, &ldquo;just clap in the words, &lsquo;and Thimble,&rsquo;
will you be so good; and I&rsquo;ll have the two mottoes
painted up in the parlour, instead of my wife&rsquo;s
portrait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let me,&rdquo; said a voice behind them; it was
the stranger&rsquo;s&mdash;Michael Warden&rsquo;s; &ldquo;let me claim
the benefit of those inscriptions. Mr. Heathfield
and Dr. Jeddler, I might have deeply wronged you
both. That I did not, is no virtue of my own. I will
not say that I am six years wiser than I was, or
better. But I have known, at any rate, that term
of selfreproach. I can urge no reason why you
should deal gently with me. I abused the hospitality
of this house; and learnt my own demerits,
with a shame I never have forgotten, yet with some
profit too I would fain hope, from one,&rdquo; he glanced
at Marion, &ldquo;to whom I made my humble supplication
for forgiveness, when I knew her merit and
my deep unworthiness. In a few days I shall quit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
this place for ever. I entreat your pardon. Do
as you would
be done by!
Forget, and
forgive!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;from whom I had the latter portion of
this story, and with whom I have the pleasure of
a personal acquaintance of some five and thirty
years&rsquo; duration&mdash;informed me, leaning easily upon
his scythe, that Michael Warden never went away
again, and never sold his house, but opened it afresh,
maintained a golden mean of hospitality, and had
a wife, the pride and honor of that country-side, whose
name was Marion. But as I have observed that Time
confuses facts occasionally, I hardly know what weight
to give to his authority.</p>
